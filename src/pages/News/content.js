          "India assumed the G20 presidency on December 1, and since then, the world has witnessed the essence of Indian hospitality. With a vision of a shared future, India looks to the G20 presidency as an opportunity. Today, the world is facing unprecedented challenges, thanks to the after-effects of Covid-19, global conflicts, an impending climate crisis, and economic uncertainty. Over the last couple of years, much of the global energy has been focused on protecting lives during the pandemic and preserving livelihoods affected by it. India’s presidency allows the world to focus on the 4Ds: De-escalating conflicts, more digitalisation to enable fast-paced, equitable and inclusive development and striving for an equitable framework of decarbonisation to fight the climate crisis.",
          "Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s statement — today’s era is not an era of war — during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in September resonated across the globe. The statement also formed the basis of the joint declaration of the G20 on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The G20 provides an opportunity to continue to espouse the de-escalation of global conflicts. Multi-alignment and the promotion of rules-based multilateralism have been the essence of India’s foreign and economic policy. India is a part of several multilateral forums, and each of them has played a constructive role in making the world safer and more secure. It has also been able to voice the concerns of developing nations and ensure that their interests are protected. With the G20 presidency, India can act as a bridge between the large and powerful nations where it belongs and the smaller, developing nations that trust it.",
          "Between 2005 and 2021, India pulled out 415 million people from multi-dimensional poverty. Over the last eight years, we have seen an acceleration in poverty alleviation through technology and digitalisation. In 2014, India embarked on a government-led drive where close to 500 million bank accounts were opened for the poor and underprivileged, including 260 million women. With India’s Digital Identity system — Aadhaar, and a Unified Payment Interface (UPI) — interventions and welfare transfers have been targeted at an individual level. ",
          "In the 1980s, a former PM remarked that only 15% (15 paise of 1 rupee) reached beneficiaries. In 2020, while the world was in the middle of a pandemic, India was able to secure the livelihood of the poorest by making critical targeted cash transfers. Today India’s world-class digital public infrastructure of identity systems and real-time payment systems is a model for the rest of the world. Even during Covid-19, the vaccine platform, CoWin, helped India scale its vaccination efforts and administer more than two billion doses. The developed and developing world can emulate these systems, and India will be sharing its experience and learnings with them.",
          "As the Indian economy grows and Indians become more affluent, India’s energy needs will also rise. In 2015, at the COP21 summit in Paris, India committed to 40% of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. This target was achieved in November 2021. India has shown the world that pursuing a development agenda and protecting the environment can go hand-in-hand. India has been crucial in promoting multilateral initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance. PM Modi has often spoken about tackling the climate crisis through climate justice — an equitable framework with differentiated responsibilities where the developed world leads in climate finance and technology transition. India has the credibility to continue this dialogue into the G20 and ensure that these differentiated responsibilities are adhered to.",
          "India has freely shared ideas and knowledge across the world. The theme for India’s presidency of the G20, One Earth, One Family, One Future, is inspired by the Sanskrit phrase Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family). The theme resonates with our ancient philosophy and sets the course for a joint call for responsibility, action and prosperity. Across India’s 20,000 languages and diverse cultures, the idea of a shared global future and an intertwined world order is a common theme. Kaniyan Poongunranar, the famous Tamil poet in the 6th century BCE, wrote, “All the places on earth are our towns and all the people are our relatives, all are evolved from common ancestors”. These philosophies have not just been handed over from generation to generation but have also been embodied in our national consciousness. It now regularly reflects in how India engages with the world.",
          "In times of crisis and in the middle of the pandemic, India provided Covid-19-related medical and other assistance to over 150 countries. Through the Vaccine Maitri Programme, India provided approximately 75 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to 94 countries and two United Nations entities. During the hostilities between Russia and Ukraine, the government evacuated 22,500 Indian students by operating more than 90 flights and rescued more than 150 foreign nationals from 20 countries.",
          "As India assumes the G20 presidency, the goals that it has set itself for the next 25 years as a part of Amrit Kaal can form the basis of a shared global future with joint prosperity. India will have an action-oriented and development-oriented presidency striving for a rules-based global order promoting international peace and advocating for just and equitable growth in a sustainable, holistic and inclusive manner. This is very much in the art of the possible. ",

          "India has formally assumed the presidency of G-20 on December 1 and the Heads of Government Summit has been planned for the second half of 2023. The G20 summit would be qualitatively different from any of the previous multilateral summits that India has hosted. None of the previous summits had the world’s largest economies assembled in one place nor did they have the entire P-5 (permanent members of the UN Security Council) represented. In that sense, the G-20 summit would be the first of its kind in Indian history.",
          "But this alone is not what makes the Indian presidency of G-20 a turning point at this juncture in geopolitics. There are seven interplaying, unique factors that make India’s presidency a watershed moment.",
          "First, among large democracies, India has by far been the best performer in handling the Covid-19 pandemic. This includes the entire gamut of responses – from the initial emergency measures like the lockdown’s timing and public communication to the entire chain of vaccination logistics. The contrast with the still unfolding draconian measures in China, the only country of comparable size, makes the Indian success more commendable. For the world, the Indian public goods delivery mechanism, at a billion-plus scale, has set a new template. If India can do it (at a billion plus scale), why can’t we (at a few million scale) would be the new refrain in much of the world.",
          "Second, the management of the economy by India during the pandemic has been extraordinarily prudent with prescient decision-making. Many glittering “stars” of the economic world panned the Modi government for not following their advice to recklessly print money and spend and later repent. Those who followed that advice – Europe and the US – are witnessing five-decadal high inflation and stalling economies. India, on the other hand, has tamed inflation to moderate levels, emerged as the fastest-growing major economy in the world and is now termed as the “only economic bright spot” in the world. India’s real-time decision making in a crisis, and that it did not get coerced by “expert advice”, has put a new sheen on India’s economic team.",
          "Third, India’s independent foreign policy, so visibly demonstrated in the ongoing NATO-Russia (Ukraine) war, has made the world sit up and take notice. The assertion of its national interest is also markedly different from the “glory” days of Non-Aligned Movement. Then it was a policy essentially of disengaging from the major world players, laced with empty posturing and mostly at the peril of national interest. Now, the India First policy is about engaging with every player on the world stage with the sole intent of promoting supreme national interest. One day, it could mean purchasing ballistic missiles defence shield from Russia and the next day birthing a grouping like Quad along with the US. Never before has Indian foreign policy been this deft.",
          "Fourth, this is the only time post-Independence that India has its own success models to offer the world. From scaling up of a seamless digital payment model built on the public digital infrastructure (UPI) to the unique digital identity, and from the successful financial inclusion model of the bottom quintile to the seamless transition to green energy, India now has many models to showcase, particularly for the developing world.",
          "Fifth, despite the current short-term preoccupation of the West with the war in Ukraine, the emerging medium to long-term global pivot is undeniably towards Asia. In the Asian theatre, meaningful geopolitics is impossible without India having a decisive say. Emerging groups such as the Quad, U2I2 and the IPEF are a testimony to this changed reality. India’s salience has never been this pivotal, post-Independence.",
          "Sixth, in the last 200 years, India is the only country to have emerged with a geopolitical heft that is part of the international consensus – democracy, vibrant civil society, free press and judiciary – and yet, is different from the western system. All other countries that emerged on the global stage during this period were either part of the Western consensus or not part of the international consensus or too small to matter on the global stage. This places India in a unique position that has not been available to any other country in recent centuries.",
          "Seventh, the demonstrably successful leadership that Prime Minister Narendra Modi provides not just to India but, on key global strategic issues to the world makes this a unique moment for India, not available post-independence.",
          "The combination of these seven factors, at this juncture in the evolving new global order, is poised to make the G20 in 2023 a historic turning point. Time for an inclusive, ambitious, action-oriented and decisive G20. Time for India’s presidency.",
