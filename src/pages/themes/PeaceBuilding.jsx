          Conflicts are intricate human occurrences that can neither be good nor
          bad, inevitable nor always have negative outcomes. They can encourage
          disruption as well as change and innovation. Whether a conflict's
          outcome is favorable or negative for individuals participating in it
          depends on the goals and the dedication to achieving those goals no
          matter the means used. Conflicts leave a wake of indiscriminate
          violence and devastation, and before going to war, there is always an
          effort to settle the conflict peacefully.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, all types of societal and international players have
          worked to find a solution to their disputes throughout history in
          order to manage them effectively and, while maximizing their profits,
          to control their costs. The conflict might be either legally or
          politically unjustifiable. However, there are other ways to account
          for political and legal disparities between countries. Short of going
          to war, these disagreements can be settled amicably or violently.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for states to continue pursuing their objectives peacefully,
          tensions between them must be reduced or kept at levels that are
          consistent with peaceful conflict resolution (individual or
          collective). It would be necessary to fully describe the many and
          complicated types and degrees of the contentious and shared issues
          among the community's members in order to fully describe the processes
          of conflict resolution within that setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two common responses to a threat are passivity (flight) and
          violent opposition (fight), thanks to the widespread knowledge of the
          fight-or-flight response. However, active nonviolence is an additional
          option. Despite being non-violent, the flight response sidesteps
          dealing with the danger. Therefore, the appearance of flight can be
          one of submission, passivity, disengagement, or surrender. The fight
          response, which responds to violence with violence, might take the
          form of an armed uprising, revenge, or violent rebellion. A third
          option for retaliation is active nonviolence. Contrary to what the
          phrase "nonviolence" could imply, which is that of passiveness,
          nonviolence is an active response that directly addresses the threat
          and has the ability to turn adversaries into allies. Non-cooperation,
          intervention, self-suffering, protest, and the development of
          alternative systems are all examples of active nonviolence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, creativity, discipline, courage, and strength are
          necessary for active nonviolence. To redirect rage over injustice
          toward the creation of chances that stop violent cycles and engage
          enemies in productive dialogue, creativity and discipline are needed.
          To manage one's fear and endure while facing injustice, one needs
          courage and strength. Gandhi referred to nonviolence as the weapon of
          the strong and violence as the weapon of the weak because of these
          characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are three classifications of nonviolent action. Emerging
          research demonstrates the effectiveness of nonviolence in each of
          these situations.

              Non-cooperation with repressive social, economic, and political
              systems, nonviolent protest, and the establishment of alternative
              institutions of government are all examples of civil resistance.
              Civil resistance may result in regime change or the repeal of
              repressive laws and practises, or it may contribute to peacemaking
              by facilitating negotiations between conflicting parties.

              Building, defending, and maintaining democratic structures against
              invasion, coup d'Ã©tat, natural disasters, or other dangers is
              referred to as civil defense. Creating means to alter unjust
              structures, processes, and policies as well as to ease tensions,
              settle disputes, and end confrontations without using force falls
              under the broad umbrella of civil defense. Agriculture and natural
              resource management, water and sanitation, as well as access to
              education, health, and social assistance programmes, are a few
              examples of civil defense or peacebuilding activities.

              <b>Civilian Protection</b> <br />
              The practice of sending out groups of prepared, unarmed
              individuals before, during, or after a violent conflict is known
              as unarmed civilian protection (UCP). UCP aims to prevent or
              lessen violence, to directly protect threatened civilian
              populations physically, and to enhance or develop resilient local
              peace infrastructures. UCP is thought to be a type of
              peacekeeping.

        </ul>
        <p>
          The majority of UCP practitioners are nonpartisan and actively engage
          in communication with all conflicting groups. Relationship building,
          proactive engagement, monitoring, and capacity development are key UCP
          strategies. These strategies have been used to successfully train
          civilians to monitor cease-fires, to encourage communication between
          rival factions, and to inform civilians about how to defend
          themselves, especially women and children.

          Collaboration of the Global North and the Global South
        </h4>
        <p>
          The socioeconomic gap between many countries in the Southern
          hemisphere and those in the Northern hemisphere is described by the
          idea of the Global North and South, however the reality is undoubtedly
          more nuanced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there are obvious advantages for both the North and the
          South, how precisely does one build up a North-South collaboration?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are development organizations that, despite being focused on
          humanitarian partnership, frequently sponsor projects including that
          collaboration. Furthermore, several organisations have entire offices
          devoted to North-South cooperation. Finding the diaspora of South
          Americans working in the North, and vice versa, is another place to
          start.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the process has started, it is essential to be clear in order to
          prevent miscommunications. After the objectives are defined, an agenda
          that corrects any imbalances can be created. Although the South
          typically receives the majority of the funding for these initiatives
          since they typically have less available for research, this does not
          imply that the liabilities should be unfairly distributed. The
          explanation of obligations is the next natural step.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several functions played by civil society in peacebuilding
          processes . These functions include protection, monitoring, advocacy,
          socialization, social cohesion, facilitation, and service delivery.

              Protection is the provision of security requirements by members of
              civil society, either independently or in collaboration with other
              organisations. Normally, the state performs this as one of its
              primary duties, but under situations of extreme state fragility
              and conflict, the connection between the state and society may
              deteriorate. Protection becomes a need for other civil society
              responsibilities both during and after a conflict since civil
              society actors find it extremely difficult to take on
              peacebuilding tasks when they are threatened with violence.
            </span>
            <p>
              The phrase "civil society protection" is frequently used to refer
              to specialised protection NGOs like Peace Brigades International
              that provide direct or indirect support to local players, such as
              serving as a watchdog or international accompaniment. When these
              initiatives have been methodically paired with monitoring and
              advocacy activities, they have proven to be more successful.

              International and local civil society organisations keep an eye on
              pertinent topics, like the state of human rights or the
              application of agreements, and they offer advice and data to
              decision-makers or organisations that support human rights. Such
              monitoring can act as an early warning system as well as a means
              of holding governments and armed organisations responsible for
              wrongdoings or subpar performance. No monitoring programme for the
              Oslo process in the context of the Israel-Palestine conflict was
              ever established throughout the 1990s. Given that the parties were
              criticised for breaking their commitments, this could have had a
              significant influence.

              Actors from civil society might advocate for the opening of
              negotiations, for the implementation of negotiated accords, or
              against a resumption of hostilities. International advocacy
              efforts that lobby against things like land mines, blood diamonds,
              or using children as troops are also significant. There are two
              types of advocacy: public and private. Public advocacy may take
              the form of petitions, rallies, press releases, social media
              campaigns, or public relations initiatives. Non-public advocacy
              typically uses back channels and relies on unofficial interactions
              and connections. When organizations are knowledgeable about
              campaigning, base their advocacy on the findings of monitoring
              programmes, and understand how to use the media to further their
              cause, advocacy campaigns have a greater impact.

              Families, schools, religious organisations, secular and cultural
              organisations, and the workplace are the major institutions in
              society that have an impact on how people acquire democracy and
              conflict-response behaviour. These socialisation venues typically
              perpetuate existing divisions in conflict-ridden nations. The
              majority of socialisation initiatives have concentrated on working
              on short-term projects with NGOs, who lack the genuine power to
              socialise individuals due to their restricted access and reach.

              Initiatives to promote social cohesion may have a greater impact
              when they try to unite individuals over a common goal rather than

              initiatives have not been as successful as long-term systematic

              In a process of peace or transition, civil society can serve as a
              facilitator to help bring the sides together. Both local and
              national levels of facilitation are possible. For instance,
              traditional mediation was the sole method available in Afghanistan
              under the Taliban to promote peace between the Taliban and the
              various Afghani communities. To discuss ideas for promoting peace,
              the Tribal Liaison Office assisted in setting up regional peace
              jirgas with religious and municipal authorities. Prominent members
              of civil society, foreign NGOs, and research organizations
              occasionally mediate or facilitate at the national level.

          In conclusion, civil society organizations, both local and global, are
          a crucial component of modern peacebuilding. The protection of
          citizens from violence, the provision of services, the observation of
          violations of human rights, and the promotion of an end to war and
          authoritarian rule are all vital responsibilities that civil society
          organizations continue to play. Along with their active involvement in
          Track One negotiations, civil society organizations and actors are
          crucial in fostering peace on a local level. Research has supported
          the importance of this engagement in terms of strengthening the
          longevity of peace agreements. However, the discussions and examples
          provided in this article have brought to light a number of crucial
          concerns that will determine whether or not civil society will
          continue to play a significant role in peacemaking in the future.
