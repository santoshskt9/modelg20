          Youth in a nation has the power to bring about big changes like social
          reforms, and economic growth and help to achieve global targets like
          striving for climate justice or practising sustainability. It is
          crystal clear by now that the development of the country needs active
          and meaningful participation from young people from all corners.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, the Indian Government currently invests 1,00,000 INR
          crores yearly in youth development through various targeted and
          non-targeted programmes. This has brought substantially great returns
          for the country when youth participation in government campaigns has
          increased to 67% in 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          International forums like the G20 have identified and accepted the
          youth’s role and responsibilities towards bringing global change.
          Similarly, the platform has created a youth-centric engagement group
          called Youth20 or Y20.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Y20 group allows young leaders across the globe to discuss and
          negotiate worldly matters and suggest valuable suggestions for the G20
          leaders to take forward. Under India’s G20 presidency for 2023, the
          Y20 summit will be hosted by India and the key focus will be on global
          youth leadership and partnership.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the themes for the Y20 India summit is “Climate Change and
          Disaster Risk Reduction: Making Sustainability a Way of Life.” Take a
          look at the forthwith section to understand the significance of these
          two pressing themes in the youth context and how they can inspire
          actions towards building a more resilient and sustainable future for
          all.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Transitioning to Sustainable Living</h4>
        <p>
          As the world population rapidly grows in number, the intensity of the
          earth’s finite resources decreases in number. The hour of embracing
          sustainability at all levels to provide a safe and secure environment
          for future generations is here.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this context, the United Nations has initiated a 2023 Agenda, a
          plan of action for the planet, people and prosperity. This agenda
          recognises 17 sustainable development goals and 169 targets to march
          ahead and shift the world onto a sustainably resilient path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, this 2030 Agenda applies to the world’s 1.2 billion young
          people who consist of 16% of the global population to work together in
          harmony and universal brotherhood. The effective management of
          collaborating with youth to achieve sustainability goals could assist
          in preventing and reducing threats due to climate change, gender
          inequality, hunger and poverty. This would in turn lead to a more
          inclusive, stable and developed economy around the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          On similar grounds, this year in G20, India has proposed a worldwide
          mission called, ‘LiFe (Lifestyle for Environment) initiative. It is a
          call to action for every citizen to practice sustainability and
          mindful utilisation of resources over ‘mindless destructive
          consumption.’
        </p>
        <p>
          The ‘LiFe’ initiative makes the fight against climate change
          historically democratic where every citizen plays a key role. It aims
          to inspire the citizens and communities to lead a lifestyle that is in
          close synchrony with nature’s limited resources and help minimise any
          exhaustion of those resources. A model of production and consumption
          that entails industries and markets adopting the concept of ‘reduce,
          reuse, recycle.’
        </p>
        <p>
          As India comprises more than 65% of the youth majority, they can
          actively contribute to the Lifestyle for Environment (LiFe)
          initiative. Additionally, ‘LiFe’ seeks to implement such foundation
          techniques into the regular habit to have a more powerful impact.
          Events like the 21-day challenge to mitigate needless resource wastage
          initiated by the government were lauded by youth and received good
          participation throughout the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such mass movements and campaigns are designed to mobilise almost
          every single citizen of the globe eventually for taking collective
          action towards environmental conservation and adopting sustainability.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Mitigating Disaster Risks</h4>
        <p>
          Mitigation from any natural calamity or man-made disaster is very
          important while thinking about global sustainability options. Disaster
          mitigation is a group effort to lessen the impact of disasters on
          people and property. It means working on disaster-resilient
          infrastructure, enforcing effective aids to tackle calamity-prone
          situations, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this comes the disaster risk reduction concept, which is a global
          policy focus of disaster risk management. This policy was set in 2015
          by the United Nations and sponsored by the Sendai Framework of
          Disaster Risk Reduction for 2015-2030.
        </p>
        <p>
          All strategies formulated on this concept aim at preventing disaster
          risks, the reduction of ongoing risks and solidifying economic,
          social, health and environmental resilience thus achieving sustainable
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          To work collectively towards disaster mitigation, a global
          organisation ideated by India, that is, Coalition of Disaster
          Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) has been formed to expand the
          development of resilient infrastructure at a rapid pace to answer the
          imperative sustainable development goal of providing basic amenities
          and increasing the world’s wealth in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          CDRI’s global partnership promotes disaster-resilient infrastructure
          with a series of consultations, financing mechanisms, and development
          reforms with efforts of advocacy on various platforms. Some of its
          guiding principles include:

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At this point, global collaboration on disaster response is vital and
          CDRI along with its 31 member countries and 7 international groups
          does just that. Moreover, India at the G20 this year will ideate new
          norms and methodologies to build infrastructure resilience in
          association with CDRI.

        {/* ------------------------- */}
        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Accelerating the Rise of Green Energy</h4>
        <p>
          Climate change has become a global emergency today, with many
          international organisations, national economies and institutions
          setting up newer models of climate change adaptation or coming up with
          methods to fight the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          If climate change is a shared global challenge, then it is also a
          massive energy challenge. Energy accounts for over two-thirds of
          global greenhouse gas emissions. This means energy must be at the
          heart of any solution to tackle rising temperatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve the goals of sustainable development, energy emissions must
          decline and this requires a dramatic acceleration in the transitions
          towards clean, renewable and sustainable energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, renewable technologies like solar panels, wind turbines,
          and hydropower in recent years are indicative that clean energy
          solutions are possible and would decrease energy emission rates
          exponentially if deployed right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Fun Fact: </b>According to International Renewable Energy Agency
          (IRENA), there was an 85% decrease in the cost of electricity due to
          the use of solar energy in the decade of 2010-2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, efficient, reliable renewable technologies can create a
          system less prone to market shocks and improve resilience and energy
          security by diversifying power supply options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, to achieve global green energy ambitions, there can be fiscal
          and regulatory interventions. Policies that concentrate to increase
          private sector participation and reforms to make renewable energy
          expansion more financially proficient. For instance,
          Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) in India is significantly working
          towards improving energy efficiency, business and public safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another significant factor to consider is the youth’s voice when it
          comes to climate action. The youth perception is vital and required
          today more as nations around the globe are in rigorous competition to
          become more developed climate action takers.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to UNDP’s People Climate Vote 2022 survey, Under-18 youth
          popularly supported renewable energy promotion policy as compared to
          adults with almost a 13% generational divide. Also, their views on
          forest conservation and land to tackle climate change issue policies
          varied from adults’ perception by a 10% difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, today the youth are becoming more inclined to advocate
          and accept the cause of green development, making climate-conscious
          choices in lifestyle like reducing the wastage of resources and opting
          for eco-friendly transportation.
