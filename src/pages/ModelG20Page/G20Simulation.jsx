                                Model G20 simulation for institutions is designed to replicate the actual G20 summit or
                                Group Twenty summit of leaders from developed to emerging economies. It is aimed and
                                designed for young learners, and professionals who wish to ace the art of public speaking
                                and diplomacy. A minimum of 1-7 representatives or delegates are needed in each of the
                                20 teams to represent each participating country.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Typically, the G20 summit consists of two parallel tracks - The Finance track and the Sherpa
                            track. Each track's meeting is held separately wherein they discuss and negotiate matters of
                            economic and political importance. Since G20 has become a crucial platform for world
                            leaders to engage in a dialogue a third track is added in the form of a Leaders Track.

                        <p className='mb-5'>
                            Therefore participants are clubbed into 3 majors groups or Tracks, namely:

                                The Finance Track team for each country is typically represented by a Finance Minister, A
                                Central Bank Governor and Senior Advisors. They discuss the macroeconomic issues
                                facing the world and are responsible to come up with reforms to mitigate global economic
                                threats.

                                This track is led by the sherpas or emissaries of G20 leaders. It focuses on the
                                developmental and socio-political agendas of the summit. The team for each country can be
                                represented by a Sherpa, a Sous-Sherpa (deputy to the Sherpa) and Senior Advisors.
                                This group focuses on the developmental and socio-political challenges faced by the
                                member countries and the world.

                                Another Track, that works parallel to these tracks is the Leaders Track - Which is a group
                                which typically comprises of the Head of States, but G20 essentially is a meeting of
                                economics and socio-political experts and the Leaders track is only responsible for setting
                                the agenda and negotiating terms at the end of the Finance and Sherpa track meetings.
