            <p>
              In recent times, the throwaway culture has gathered much traction.
              It stems from the social concept of a throw-away society that is
              strongly affected by consumerism, where people tend to use items
              of single-use and disposable packaging. It is an overall critical
              viewpoint of overconsumption and excessive usage of limited
              shelf-life goods and products.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is believed that due to environmental destruction and adverse
              climatic shifts, the population without proper action will face
              acute scarcity of basic needs like water, food, etc. Moreover, the
              global economy could lose up to 18% of GDP BY 2050.

              Under the LiFE initiative, the focus shall be to transition from
              this so-called throw-away society to a more circular economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The government authorities have initiated several reforms and
              policies to mitigate the throw-away influence from the masses and
              a change in the behaviour of the citizens towards economic
              conservation. Some of the successful campaigns are:

              Mission LiFE makes the fight against climate change historically
              democratic where every citizen plays a key role. LiFE in itself is
              a circular existence where a person is born, lives and then dies.
              However, how life is lived in regard to earth’s finite resources
              is what counts.

            <p className="text-dark mt-3 fs-5">
              Moreover, it aims to inspire the citizens and communities to lead
              a lifestyle that is in close synchrony of nature’s limited
              resources and help minimise any exhaustion of those resources.
              Taking a hint from the above thought comes the idea of the
              circular economy. A model of production and consumption that
              entails industries and markets adopting the concept of ‘reduce,
              reuse, recycle.’

            <p className="text-dark mt-3 fs-5">
              Furthermore, it majorly involves leasing, sharing, refurbishing,
              repairing and recycling existing models or products to a realistic
              end rather than scrapping them off in single use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interestingly, India is the first country across the globe to
              include LiFE in its list of nationally determined contributions.
              From this, the nation hopes to set and propagate healthy ways of
              sustainable existence and values of conservation of the ecosystem
              to combat climate change.
