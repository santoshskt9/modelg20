      "The 2008 financial crisis is said to be one of mankind’s biggest economic mistakes. The Global Financial Crisis was a result of pure shortsightedness and poor judgment. Before we dive deep into who steered us away from the whirlpool, let’s understand what brought us into such deep waters.",

        paragraph: [
          "Years of unusually low interest rates and lax lending requirements drove a house price bubble in the US and internationally laid the groundwork for the financial catastrophe. In the beginning it was all set out with good intentions. In response to the dot-com bubble crash, numerous corporate accounting scandals, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Federal Reserve decreased the fund rate, as low as 1%, in an effort to stimulate the economy by making money readily vailable to companies and consumers at low rates.",
          "As a result of borrowers taking advantage of the low mortgage rates, housing values began to  rise rapidly. It was possible for people with bad credit or no credit history to fulfill their dream of owning a property. Homeownership eventually reached its saturation point as interest rates began to increase. The Federal Funds Rate reached 5.25% two years after the Fed began hiking rates in June 2004, and it stayed there until August 2007.",
          "In early 2006, the prices of the homes and estate began to fall. For many Americans, this created quite some difficulty. Now their homes were worth less than what they paid for. They owed money to their lenders, and consequently they were unable to sell their homes. If they had adjustable-rate mortgages, their expenses increased as the value of their properties decreased. The most vulnerable subprime borrowers were forced to stay in mortgages that they couldn't actually afford.",
          "One subprime lender after another declared bankruptcy as 2007 got under way. It became clear that the subprime crisis could not be resolved by the financial markets and that its effects extended well beyond American territory. The U.S. economy had entered a full-fledged recession by the winter of 2008, and as financial institutions struggled to maintain liquidity, stock markets globally were seeing their steepest decline since the September 11 terrorist attacks.",
          "By the summer of 2008, the carnage was spreading across the financial sector. The historic bankruptcy of the renowned Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers in September was the biggest in American history, and it served as a symbol of the devastation brought on by the global financial crisis for many.",

        paragraph: [
          "Obviously no single individual can solve a global problem, nor can a single international or national or local government or regional grouping. The crisis has demonstrated it is not enough to change things around to have specialised organisations handling policy in their respective niches. There was a need for orchestrating a new way of solving global crises – high food and energy prices, increasing competition for limited resources on a global scale, a decline in confidence in our banking systems, and the need for job creation to develop a long-lasting recovery are all factors.",
          "The emergence of the G20 provided a forum where government leaders from around the globe, developed, developing and emerging economies, could come together to tackle these issues. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and other significant international organizations were requested by the G20 in 2008 to assist it in responding to the world economic crisis. Since then, the OECD has taken an active role in G20 meetings and summits, contributing analysis, information, and policy suggestions on almost every topic under discussion.",
          "The root cause of the global economic crisis is a lack of confidence. The OECD created new guidelines for consumer financial protection, which the G20 finance ministers ratified in October 2011, in an effort to assist consumers regain confidence in the banking and financial system. Collaboration does not imply a slowdown in the process; the G20 requested these guiding principles in February 2011, and the OECD arranged a process that resulted in their delivery in October.",
          "The summit had arrived at the Washington declaration, according to the White House. The leaders agreed upon a list of key objectives including– reaching a focal point of understanding about the root causes of the crisis, reviewing actions taken and about to be taken by countries to address the immediate crisis and strengthen their growth, launching an action plan to implement those principles. Ministers were also requested to develop niched recommendary solutions that would be reviewed in subsequent summits. Moreover, the G20 reaffirmed their commitment to free market principles.",
