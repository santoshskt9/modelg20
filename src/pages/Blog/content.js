          "Years of unusually low interest rates and lax lending requirements drove a house price bubble in the US and internationally laid the groundwork for the financial catastrophe. In the beginning it was all set out with good intentions. In response to the dot-com bubble crash, numerous corporate accounting scandals, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Federal Reserve decreased the fund rate, as low as 1%, in an effort to stimulate the economy by making money readily vailable to companies and consumers at low rates.",
          "As a result of borrowers taking advantage of the low mortgage rates, housing values began to  rise rapidly. It was possible for people with bad credit or no credit history to fulfill their dream of owning a property. Homeownership eventually reached its saturation point as interest rates began to increase. The Federal Funds Rate reached 5.25% two years after the Fed began hiking rates in June 2004, and it stayed there until August 2007.",
          "In early 2006, the prices of the homes and estate began to fall. For many Americans, this created quite some difficulty. Now their homes were worth less than what they paid for. They owed money to their lenders, and consequently they were unable to sell their homes. If they had adjustable-rate mortgages, their expenses increased as the value of their properties decreased. The most vulnerable subprime borrowers were forced to stay in mortgages that they couldn't actually afford.",
          "One subprime lender after another declared bankruptcy as 2007 got under way. It became clear that the subprime crisis could not be resolved by the financial markets and that its effects extended well beyond American territory. The U.S. economy had entered a full-fledged recession by the winter of 2008, and as financial institutions struggled to maintain liquidity, stock markets globally were seeing their steepest decline since the September 11 terrorist attacks.",
          "By the summer of 2008, the carnage was spreading across the financial sector. The historic bankruptcy of the renowned Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers in September was the biggest in American history, and it served as a symbol of the devastation brought on by the global financial crisis for many.",

The crisis has demonstrated it is not enough to change things around to have specialised organisations handling policy in their respective niches.

Collaboration does not imply a slowdown in the process; the G20 requested these guiding principles in February 2011, and the OECD arranged a process that resulted in their delivery in October.",

The leaders agreed upon a list of key objectives including– reaching a focal point of understanding about the root causes of the crisis, reviewing actions taken and about to be taken by countries to address the immediate crisis and strengthen their growth, launching an action plan to implement those principles. Ministers were also requested to develop niched recommendary solutions that would be reviewed in subsequent summits. Moreover, the G20 reaffirmed their commitment to free market principles.",

This also means that what happens in one part of the world can affect the other regions irrespective of spatial and cultural dissimilarities. It is an age where the successes and failures of a nation are not contained within the national boundaries. This stands true for India as well, where the path it takes over the next few years is closely watched by the world and will also determine the trajectory of global development.",
          "As a country which accounts for one-sixth of the world’s population and has a huge demographic dividend, India has always held a significant global position. Due to its unique geographical location in South Asia, its colonial history, active participation in international forums and its alliance-building characteristic, India is also seen as a more lucrative partner in global economic growth and influential in shaping global trends. In India, 183 million more people between the ages of 15 and 64 are expected to be added to the labour force between 2020 and 2050. Further, it is expected that by 2027, India’s working-age population will grow to be 18.6% of the global labour force. Making this population pool a fully equipped resource in terms of education, skills, and health would also generate a vital source of labour for the rest of the world. It is widely acknowledged that India and the rest of the world stand to gain significantly from maximising the potential of this resource. Additionally, the labour force would unlock the potential consumer demand for industries to meet. According to the World Economic Forum, the middle class will comprise the largest proportion of the population in India by 2030 and is predicted to account for 75% of consumer expenditure in 2030, up from roughly 50% presently. Around 80% of households will have middle incomes by that time. This would further lead to exponential demand, increasing India’s consumption costs and making it profitable.",

This market would have exponential demand, which would increase India’s consumption costs and make it profitable. If India is successful in utilising its demographic dividend, a more educated and better-employed youth population will support the consumption increase from this expanding middle-class group with the addition of almost 140 million additional families. Globally, industries will have the chance to serve this market better and utilise the population’s youth and skills.",

According to IMF estimates, India contributes roughly 15% of global growth despite facing significant obstacles like poverty, unequal resource distribution, and inadequate healthcare and education. In addition, from 2000 to 2020, India’s contribution to the global GDP at current prices (PPP) rose from 4% to 6.8%. This compels one to consider the likelihood of global growth once India achieves a more equitable distribution of prosperity among its various classes, communities, and regions. India’s actual potential will be unleashed, and the country will be able to contribute to global prosperity in a much more significant way if the obstacles that stand in its way are overcome.",
          "By obtaining USD 83.57 billion in FDI, India set a record for annual FDI inflow and demonstrated its rapid rise as a top investment destination. FDI inflows have increased 20 times during the past 20 years. Ongoing efforts are to improve India’s status as a secure and desirable investment location. FDI inflows boost production, make it easier for investors to transfer knowledge, and as a result, provide India with a competitive edge in a variety of industries. ",

In total, 98 nations received more than 235 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from India. India’s potential to share the benefits of its domestic scientific research system would be further improved by improving the manufacturing and scientific research ecosystem. Going beyond national interests demonstrates a global solidarity ethos. The country has become a key participant in the Asian bloc and an important participant in the changing geopolitical landscape of a multipolar world. Furthermore, India’s decision to address its sustainability goals and issues related to economic growth can provide an example for many other developing countries in a similar position, especially regarding climate change. ",
          "India’s approach will certainly have an impact on the rest of the world in the following decades. Long-term economic success for India rests on its ability to create a clear national value proposition that identifies the opportunities and features of its business environment. Numerous non-economic elements also affect a country’s ability to influence the global economy. It is essential to consider India’s success beyond only its strength on the economic front. India’s capacity to make social progress, produce in a sustainable manner, and distribute assets and value more fairly must all be considered while defining success in India. By including all of the previously described factors, the competitiveness framework redefines what success means for India. ",

          "As the world is becoming more urban than ever, it is crucial to place cities at the centre of the development agenda to try to enhance their liveability and mobility. At the same time, it is vital to place economic growth and sustainability parallel to each other. Focussing on sustainability is particularly important for addressing the environmental challenges facing cities that have become routine features — air and water pollution, traffic jams, congestion and waterlogging. In this context, conversations on urban design encourage targeted deliberations that seek to scale up approaches to making cities smart and sustainable and helping them mature into places of socio-economic opportunities for its expanding labour force. A better quality of life, a safer and more secure environment, and a greater ability to function as an urban entity are just a few of the vital benefits of effective urban planning methods. Inclusive urban design generates results that holistically make for better-built environments and, in turn, a way of living, regardless of the size of a city planning project. Additionally, it gives each city a distinct sense of identity and creates the foundation for greater adaptability to changing climatic, economic, or social factors.",
          "In this setting, the idea of a “smart city” combines information and communication technology (ICT) with numerous physical devices linked to an Internet of Things (IoT) network in order to connect with inhabitants and improve the effectiveness of local operations and services. City municipalities may engage directly with both community and city infrastructure, thanks to smart city technology, which also enables them to keep an eye on what is occurring in the city and how it is changing. ICT is utilised to improve the quality of urban services, their effectiveness, and interactivity, as well as to cut costs and resource usage and improve citizen-government interaction. Frameworks for smart cities are created to control urban traffic and enable quick responses. The concept of a smart city depends upon gathering data and information that is further used to improve the processes, operations and governance systems of the city. Furthermore, this data is leveraged for managing resources, assets and services effectively and efficiently. A smart city is driven by information systems and aids the monitoring and managing of utilities like power plants, water supply networks and garbage disposal to services like schools and hospitals.",
          "Additionally, the spread and support of discourse on sustainability have also significantly influenced how our cities are planned and developed, in addition to this development. Today, the idea of a smart city is seen as a vision, manifesto, or promise that seeks to define the ideal and sustainable city design for the 21stcentury. A smart city is thus a productive, technologically advanced, environmentally friendly, and socially inclusive metropolis. In other words, smart city applications put a specific technical focus in the foreground of developing solutions for ecological, sociological, economic, and management concerns. In India, the concept of smart cities (under the aegis of the Smart Cities Mission) is based on six fundamental principles – putting the community at the core of planning and implementation, optimal use of resources in a way that generates more outcomes using lesser resources, cooperative and competitive federalism, adopting innovative methods for sustainable solutions, using technology as a means to achieving goals and financial convergence.",
          "Currently, 54 per cent of the world’s population lives in cities, and that percentage is predicted to rise to 66 per cent by 2050 due to urbanisation, which will result in the addition of 2.5 billion more people to cities over the course of the next three decades. In order to keep up with this rapid expansion— which is straining the resources of our cities — environmental, social, and economic sustainability is essential. According to the World Bank, smart cities make the process of urbanisation more inclusive through the integration of migrants and the impoverished into the city; bringing together the formal and informal sectors; connecting the urban centres and peripheries; and providing services for both the rich and the poor. These smart and digital cities with embedded networks of surveillance also offer protection and security through an enhanced criminal investigation mechanism.",
          "Rethinking cities to make them more liveable, inclusive, and integrated is a key component in promoting smart cities. Smart cities need to build fair, participatory, sustainable, inclusive, and all-encompassing urban development policies and planning in order to achieve these feasible goals. Moreover, to better plan for expansion and handle day-to-day operational issues, we must provide our cities with dynamic mechanisms. This, therefore, facilitates proper strategic planning, development, and management activities that serve as a coherent vision for the future of urban ecosystems in our smart cities. In order to improve the quality of life and lessen the environmental impact of urbanisation, a sustainable smart city with environmental, social, economic, and cultural dimensions must be established. This city must also integrate the newest technology with governance and enhance innovative socio-technical, socio-economic, and sociocultural aspects of growth.",
