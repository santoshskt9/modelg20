          Youth in a nation has the power to bring about big changes like social
          reforms, and economic growth and help to achieve global targets like
          striving for climate justice or practising sustainability. It is
          crystal clear by now that the development of the country needs active
          and meaningful participation from young people from all corners.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, the Indian Government currently invests 1,00,000 INR
          crores yearly in youth development through various targeted and
          non-targeted programmes. This has brought substantially great returns
          for the country when youth participation in government campaigns has
          increased to 67% in 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          International forums like the G20 have identified and accepted the
          youth’s role and responsibilities towards bringing global change.
          Similarly, the platform has created a youth-centric engagement group
          called Youth20 or Y20.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Y20 group allows young leaders across the globe to discuss and
          negotiate worldly matters and suggest valuable suggestions for the G20
          leaders to take forward. Under India’s G20 presidency for 2023, the
          Y20 summit will be hosted by India and the key focus will be on global
          youth leadership and partnership.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the themes for the Y20 India summit is “Climate Change and
          Disaster Risk Reduction: Making Sustainability a Way of Life.” Take a
          look at the forthwith section to understand the significance of these
          two pressing themes in the youth context and how they can inspire
          actions towards building a more resilient and sustainable future for
          all.

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Transitioning to Sustainable Living</h4>
        <p>
          As the world population rapidly grows in number, the intensity of the
          earth’s finite resources decreases in number. The hour of embracing
          sustainability at all levels to provide a safe and secure environment
          for future generations is here.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this context, the United Nations has initiated a 2023 Agenda, a
          plan of action for the planet, people and prosperity. This agenda
          recognises 17 sustainable development goals and 169 targets to march
          ahead and shift the world onto a sustainably resilient path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, this 2030 Agenda applies to the world’s 1.2 billion young
          people who consist of 16% of the global population to work together in
          harmony and universal brotherhood. The effective management of
          collaborating with youth to achieve sustainability goals could assist
          in preventing and reducing threats due to climate change, gender
          inequality, hunger and poverty. This would in turn lead to a more
          inclusive, stable and developed economy around the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the European Union (EU) considers climate changer to be the most serious issue faced by
          the world today and actively supports steps in the education and training sector to raise the effort
          scale to tackle the climate crisis. The EU Commission at present supports all EU member states in
          their attempts to

          On 16 June 2022, the Council of the European Union (EU) adopted a Recommendation on learning
          for the green transition and sustainable development. This recommendation is a key policy
          statement highlighting the crucial role of education and training in working towards the goals of
          achieving sustainable development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is to bring to light that sustainability should be part of the entire spectrum of education and
          training, including curriculum and professional development for educators, as well as buildings,
          infrastructure and operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year in G20, India has proposed a worldwide
          mission called, ‘LiFe (Lifestyle for Environment) initiative. It is a
          call to action for every citizen to practice sustainability and
          mindful utilisation of resources over ‘mindless destructive
          consumption.’
        </p>
        <p>
          The ‘LiFe’ initiative makes the fight against climate change
          historically democratic where every citizen plays a key role. It aims
          to inspire the citizens and communities to lead a lifestyle that is in
          close synchrony with nature’s limited resources and help minimise any
          exhaustion of those resources. A model of production and consumption
          that entails industries and markets adopting the concept of ‘reduce,
          reuse, recycle.’
        </p>
        <p>
          As India comprises more than 65% of the youth majority, they can
          actively contribute to the Lifestyle for Environment (LiFe)
          initiative. Additionally, ‘LiFe’ seeks to implement such foundation
          techniques into the regular habit to have a more powerful impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to recent data, an average carbon footprint of a person in India is 0.56 tonnes per year,
          compared to the global average of 4 tonnes. India's traditional knowledge, social norms and daily
          household practices strongly position it to take on individual action to tackle the climate change issue
          through this mass movement in the form of ‘LiFe Mission.’

        </p>
        <p>
          Events like the 21-day challenge to mitigate needless resource wastage
          initiated by the government were lauded by youth and received good
          participation throughout the nation. <i><b>Some of the other

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Mitigating Disaster Risks</h4>
        <p>
          Mitigation from any natural calamity or man-made disaster is very
          important while thinking about global sustainability options. Disaster
          mitigation is a group effort to lessen the impact of disasters on
          people and property. It means working on disaster-resilient
          infrastructure, enforcing effective aids to tackle calamity-prone
          situations, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Global Assessment Report on disaster risk reduction (GAR2022), If current trends
          continue, the number of disasters per year globally may increase from around 400 in 2015 to 560 per
          year by 2030 – a projected increase of 40% during the lifetime of the Sendai Framework
        </p>
        <p>
          Also it estimates that the number of extreme temperature events per year is also increasing, and
          based on current trends will almost triple between 2001 and 2030. Disasters have negative impacts
          on biodiversity and environmental sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          These trends and numbers miss to calculate the ongoing climate chnage influences that are
          accelerating which is leading to unpredictable disaster forecasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          It goes wothout saying that the global stability is at risk along with recognisable challenges to
          economy and environment. Conventional apporaches to mitigate the disasters by far have had lesser
          impacts, so syhstematic risk governance needs to develop causal structures, dynamic responses to
          tackle the global systemic risk.

          From this comes the disaster risk reduction concept, which is a global
          policy focus of disaster risk management. This policy was set in 2015
          by the United Nations and sponsored by the Sendai Framework of
          Disaster Risk Reduction for 2015-2030.
        </p>
        <p>
          All strategies formulated on this concept aim at preventing disaster
          risks, the reduction of ongoing risks and solidifying economic,
          social, health and environmental resilience thus achieving sustainable
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          To work collectively towards disaster mitigation, a global
          organisation ideated by India, that is, Coalition of Disaster
          Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) has been formed to expand the
          development of resilient infrastructure at a rapid pace to answer the
          imperative sustainable development goal of providing basic amenities
          and increasing the world’s wealth in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          CDRI’s global partnership promotes disaster-resilient infrastructure
          with a series of consultations, financing mechanisms, and development
          reforms with efforts of advocacy on various platforms. Some of its

        <p>
          At this point, global collaboration on disaster response is vital and
          CDRI along with its 31 member countries and 7 international groups
          does just that. Moreover, India at the G20 this year will ideate new
          norms and methodologies to build infrastructure resilience in
          association with CDRI.

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Accelerating the Rise of Green Energy</h4>
        <p>
          Climate change has become a global emergency today, with many
          international organisations, national economies and institutions
          setting up newer models of climate change adaptation or coming up with
          methods to fight the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          If climate change is a shared global challenge, then it is also a
          massive energy challenge. Energy accounts for over two-thirds of
          global greenhouse gas emissions. This means energy must be at the
          heart of any solution to tackle rising temperatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve the goals of sustainable development, energy emissions must
          decline and this requires a dramatic acceleration in the transitions
          towards clean, renewable and sustainable energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, renewable technologies like solar panels, wind turbines,
          and hydropower in recent years are indicative that clean energy
          solutions are possible and would decrease energy emission rates
          exponentially if deployed right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Fun Fact: </b>According to International Renewable Energy Agency
          (IRENA), there was an 85% decrease in the cost of electricity due to
          the use of solar energy in the decade of 2010-2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is believed that by 2026, global renewable electricity capacity is forecast to rise more than 60%
          from 2020 levels to over 4 800 GW – equivalent to the current total global power capacity of fossil
          fuels and nuclear combined. Renewables are set to account for almost 95% of the increase in global
          power capacity through 2026, with solar PV alone providing more than half. The amount of
          renewable capacity added over the period of 2021 to 2026 is expected to be 50% higher than from
          2015 to 2020.

        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, efficient, reliable renewable technologies can create a
          system less prone to market shocks and improve resilience and energy
          security by diversifying power supply options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, to achieve global green energy ambitions, there can be fiscal
          and regulatory interventions. Policies that concentrate to increase
          private sector participation and reforms to make renewable energy
          expansion more financially proficient. For instance,
          Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) in India is significantly working
          towards improving energy efficiency, business and public safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another significant factor to consider is the youth’s voice when it
          comes to climate action. The youth perception is vital and required
          today more as nations around the globe are in rigorous competition to
          become more developed climate action takers.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to UNDP’s People Climate Vote 2022 survey, Under-18 youth
          popularly supported renewable energy promotion policy as compared to
          adults with almost a 13% generational divide. Also, their views on
          forest conservation and land to tackle climate change issue policies
          varied from adults’ perception by a 10% difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the People’s Climate Vote was based in 18 of the G20 countries where almost 689,000
          people were polled and out of which 302,000 were youth citizens under the age of 18. This climate
          poll was significant to note the voices of the upcoming generation’s mindset.

        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, In Indonesia, for climate action, the most popular policy in youth perception emerged
          to be adopting climate-friendly farming techniques (67%), followed by forest and land conservation
          and investments in green business and jobs with (59%) and (52%) respectively.

        </p>
        <p>

          Besides this, the least supported climate policies by youth were affordable insurance (29%) and
          pollution payment by companies (27%).

        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, In India, 67% population under the age of 18 compared to 57% of adults opine that
          changing climate is a global emergency. In the People’s Climate Vote, 66,139 responses were
          received out of which a massive 31,390 responses were from the youth of India.

        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to various climate action policies, 44% of the youth supports the usage of renewable
          power, eco-friendly farming methods and conserving forests. Moreover, 43% opted to support using
          bicycles and electric vehicles and 40% opted for an early disaster warning system to act faster.

        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, today the youth are becoming more inclined to advocate
          and accept the cause of green development, making climate-conscious
          choices in lifestyle like reducing the wastage of resources and opting
          for eco-friendly transportation.
