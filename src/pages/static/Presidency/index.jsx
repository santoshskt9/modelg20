              India to Set the Agenda for the World

          <p>
            The world is currently a perfect storm and every nation is currently
            making an attempt to last the night. Every morning the headlines
            highlight a new obstacle brought to light for the leaders of today.

            As the new G20 chair, India inherits the responsibility of steering
            collective action for restoring global economic and financial
            stability in the reverberations of the pandemic and the
            Russia-Ukraine war. India's presidency would place a high priority
            on developing a solid plan for a sustained recovery in economic
            growth and readjusting the action plan to achieve the 2030 SDG
            Agenda. To speed the transition from the existing "brown" economy to
            a more sustainable and low-carbon one, the G20 must concentrate its
            efforts on developing effective policies, as well as a regulatory,
            institutional, and market environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the G20 knocking on our country’s door, there has been
            speculation being made for what should be brought up for
            deliberations by our nation. Various crises around the world have
            been stirring lately, and here’s what we feel might be the chosen
            ones.

          <h4 className="fs-2 mt-3">The dominoes are falling</h4>
          <p>
            One chaotic, disappointing year just came to an end. Another one is
            likely in store.
          </p>
          <p>
            The IMF's annual economic forecast, which was published in October,
            predicted sluggish global growth in 2023. It gave specific attention
            to three issues: the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the persistent
            consequences of COVID, particularly in China, and high inflation and
            tighter monetary policy. Given the rise in inflation and interest
            rates, as well as a significant increase in geopolitical risk, the
            fact that the world did not experience a catastrophic financial
            crisis in 2022 is a remarkable feat. However, the global financial
            system is facing a significant stress test because of the record
            levels of public and private debt that were reached during the
            now-past period of ultra-low interest rates, as well as the high
            chance of recession.
          </p>
          <p>
            The labor market remains remarkably strong at year-end, and it seems
            inevitable that it will weaken. The only question is the pace and
            severity of that weakening. Although the weakening may be gradual
            and mild, the bigger concern is a potential drop in consumption.
            Prices are going up, interest rates are going up, savings rates are
            going down, there is more borrowing, and wealth levels are going
            down for consumers. Consumer spending has been steady thus far. We
            might be in for a lengthier recession driven by consumers as the
            economy weakens rather than merely sharp drops in investment and
            corresponding job losses. The white-collar workforce will likely be
            the main target of these drops in labor demand. As a result, the
            economy may continue to struggle for a longer period of time even
            though the unemployment rate remains relatively low (4% to 5%).
          </p>
          <p>
            India, Indonesia, and Brazil would constitute the troika under the
            Presidency. The troika would include three developing nations and
            rising economies for the first time, giving them a stronger voice.
            This will provide it the unique opportunity to look at developments
            from the perspective of the developing world. The term "troika"
            refers to the G20's top hierarchy, which comprises the present,
            past, and future presidents (Indonesia, India and Brazil).

          <h4 className="fs-2 mt-3">Logo and Theme of India's Presidency</h4>
          <p>
            Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which translates to "One Earth, One Family,
            One Future," is the slogan of India's G20 presidency. It is taken
            from the Maha Upanishad, an old Sanskrit literature. The topic
            essentially emphasizes the importance of all life—human, animal,
            plant, and microorganism—as well as their interdependence on Earth
            and across the universe. The topic also emphasizes LiFE (Lifestyle
            for Environment), with its associated environmentally sound and
            responsible decisions made at the level of both individual
            lifestyles and national development, leading to globally
            transformative activities that result in a cleaner, greener, and
            bluer future
          </p>
          <p>
            The vibrant colors of India's national flag—saffron, white, green,
            and blue—were used as inspiration for the G20 Logo. Planet Earth is
            compared to the lotus, the national flower of India, which
            symbolizes growth over adversity. India's pro-planet philosophy of
            living in complete harmony with nature is reflected in the Earth.
            "Bharat" is inscribed in Devanagari script below the G20 logo.
          </p>
          <h4 className="fs-2 mt-3">What's new in 2023</h4>
          <p>
            Under India's Presidency, a new working group on disaster risk
            reduction would be established to promote group work among the G20,
            carry out multidisciplinary research, and exchange best practices on
            disaster risk reduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bangladesh, Egypt, Mauritius, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman,
            Singapore, Spain, and the UAE are the countries that India has
            invited as special guests.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following international organizations have been invited to the
            G-20: UN, IMF, World Bank, WHO, WTO, ILO, FSB, OECD, Chairs of the
            African Union, NEPAD, ASEAN, ADB, ISA, and CDRI.
          </p>
          <p>
            The G20 will have meetings in cities other than New Delhi and other
            developed cities. India will host more than 200 meetings in more
            than 50 cities across 32 different workstreams, drawing inspiration
            from its G20 Presidency theme of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"—"One Earth,
            One Family, One Future," as well as the Prime Minister's vision of a
            "all of government" approach. This will give G20 delegates and
            guests a glimpse of India's rich cultural heritage and give them an
            authentic Indian experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being the incoming G20 chair, India is bound to build on the agenda
            from what has been acquired and delivered in the previous summit in
            Bali. Indonesia was loudly vocal about three aspects- digital
            transformation, energy transition, and the global health system.

          {/* -------------------------- */}
          <h4 className="fs-2 mt-3">Key issues and talking points</h4>
          <p>
            The world’s biggest nightmare that seemed to have ceased - Covid -
            is showing signs of resumption once again. The horrors of the past
            three horrors are projecting stealthily. If it were to come back
            once again, how are the nations going to react? With the current
            trend towards a global economic crisis, is the world ready to shut
            down again? Will life cease and businesses fade away at the cost of
            health? The stakes are high and there are immediate calls to be
            taken. Moreover, the execution and implementation of global policies
            is something to be discussed in our upcoming summit.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the new G20 chair, India inherits the responsibility of steering
            collective action for restoring global economic and financial
            stability in the reverberations of the pandemic and the
            Russia-Ukraine war. The food and fuel crises triggered by the
            conflict are only getting worse with days passing by. Geopolitical
            tensions between the West and Russia hindered cooperation inside the
            G20, which posed a challenge to Indonesia's leadership. The
            credibility of the G20 has been questioned as a result of this
            split. India's neutral posture in the Russia-Ukraine conflict offers
            hope that it could be able to convince both parties to take part in
            the G20 discussions and break the current impasse. India must come
            up with innovative ways to overcome these geopolitical divides and
            open the path for dialogue centered on cooperation and shared
            prosperity. In fact, one may anticipate that India's presidency
            would influence the formulation of a clear G20 position on the
            conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design of a strong strategy for a durable rebound of economic
            growth and recalibrating the action plan for attaining the 2030 SDG
            Agenda would be priorities for India's presidency. The G20 must
            focus its efforts on creating a strong policy, as well as a
            regulatory, institutional, and market environment, in order to
            hasten the shift from the current "brown" economy to a more
            sustainable and low-carbon one
          </p>
          <p>
            Assuring an equitable economic recovery is one of the most important
            worldwide concerns in the post-pandemic and post-war age. This can
            be accomplished by coordinated efforts to maintain the multilateral
            trading system, provide open supply chains to enable the movement of
            key commodities, and diversify investment and production. Vasudhaiva
            Kutumbakam (One Earth, One Family, One Future), which emphasizes
            global interconnection and symbolizes India's pro-planet stance, is
            the subject of India's presidency. It suggests that India would work
            to increase global interconnection, capitalize on its benefits, and
            develop creative solutions to any problems that may arise as a
            result. In order to create an inclusive and sustainable multilateral
            economic system, India's G20 presidency would be crucial. India's
            presidency can serve as a neutral platform for direct discussions
            between the West and other nations.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the three main focuses during the Indonesian presidency was
            "digital transformation." The Digital Economy Task Force evolved
            into the Digital Economy Working Group in 2022. For inclusive
            economic development and to advance global cooperation on
            significant digital concerns, India must take the lead in
            prioritizing digitalization. The challenge of digital transformation
            will be addressed by developing digital solutions to hasten the
            achievement of the SDGs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to promote the adoption of G20 commitments pertaining to
            women's problems, one of the engagement groups under Indonesia's G20
            Presidency was the W20. They have expressed the hope that the four
            main issues related to women's empowerment that were pursued during
            Indonesia’s G20 Presidency will be taken up during India’s
            presidency of the grouping this year. Moreover, policies that will
            encourage the employment profiles of women and the reduction of the
            gap can be of discussion in the halls of this year’s summit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The G20 presidency presents an ideal opportunity for India to
            involve its youth in exploring innovative solutions to 'glocal'
            challenges like reducing climate change, transitioning to a just
            energy system, embracing technology, redefining the future of work,
            and achieving sustainable economic growth. One such forum inside the
            G20 system that gives the young people a chance to be heard and
            submit their answers to the G20 leaders is the Y20. The Indian G20
            presidency may use the global stage to address important issues
            affecting young people, such as jobs, technology, housing, and
            governance.

            The list of probable agendas is infinite as the list of problems in
            the world do not seem to halt. Moreover, what’s on their mind is
            dependent on India's stance on global forums.

          {/* ---------------------- */}
          <h4 className="fs-2 mt-3">The policies nurturing our youth</h4>
          <p>
            We have consistently tailored our policies to suit the brilliance of
            our youth under PM Modi's direction. The National Education Policy
            2020 is a comprehensive and forward-looking framework built on the
            tenets of accessibility, equality, quality, affordability, and
            accountability. It strives to develop each student's creative
            potential in line with the demands of the twenty-first century. Our
            people are the true resource of our country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, it is appropriate that the G20-related actions under our
            leadership centre on this collaboration. By holding the meetings in
            more than 50 different sites around the nation, the experience of
            the president will be pan-Indian.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each state government, each Union Territory, and each individual
            citizen have a stake in the outcome of India's presidency.

            Universities can provide students with the training they need to
            convey their local history as well as significant buildings, works
            of art, and other cultural practices. Then, these students can
            assist in planning some of the meetings and mentor international
            delegates. Partner universities might be chosen for various sites by
            the G20 secretariat and the department of higher education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from visiting significant historical, economic, and cultural
            sites, visitors may also enjoy immersive activities like village
            tours, nature hikes, and visits to the weekly and local markets.
            English and other G20 languages can be used to create informative
            videos. G20 delegates can post testimonies and pictures of their
            travels to the official website. Students may receive training to
            serve as session rapporteurs. For aid with translation, universities
            with foreign language departments may be especially helpful. The G20
            secretariat may employ this pool of translators and rapporteurs over
            various sessions after providing them with additional training. This
            could also serve as a human resource pool for potential future
            international gatherings that we hold.

          <p>
            Moreover, PK Mishra, the principal secretary to the Prime Minister,
            firmly believes that students and young individuals are in fact
            India's cultural ambassadors since they are the torchbearers of our
            rich heritage. The young must lead initiatives to highlight the rich
            cultural mosaic and diverse developments of their individual states
            when tourists from other areas of the world visit Indian states.
            These encounters and exchanges with foreign delegates will establish
            the groundwork for a long-lasting and mutually beneficial connection
            among the young people of all G20 nations.
