                    <p>
                        The world wide web or the internet has become the greatest digital innovation in the history of
                        mankind. It has become a major part of our lives in terms of information sharing, researching, surfing
                        for facts and data, uploading new ideas, gaming, socialising and much more. It is also a great source
                        to communicate with friends and family across borders without worrying about distances.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there are good and bad sides to enjoying free access to the internet. 1 out of 3 children
                        today is making use of the internet for studies or games. It goes without saying that the threat to
                        cyber security and safety is a lingering issue with internet services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from this, globally the cases of online cyberbullying, sexual harassment, and extortion of
                        children, and young people on the internet have been rapidly on the rise since Covid-19.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For instance, in India, 400 per cent of cybercrimes against youngsters were recorded in the early
                        pandemic phase of 2020. Almost 90% of these crimes were depicting children in physically explicit
                        acts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More such cases of cyber threats have taken over the world by storm and have widely opened the
                        need for proper safety norms to tackle the issue. There needs to be proper planning, and
                        implementation of strict regulations in schools, at home to monitor young viewers’ screen time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, understanding and generating awareness about government cyber safety policies
                        amongst the masses should be undertaken as well.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Read the forthwith blog to understand the extent of cyber threats and about various level safety
                        measures that could be used to aware the youth faction and masses in general of the rights and
                        wrongs of the internet.

                    <p className='mb-4'>
                        Cyber Security also known as internet safety is defined as the responsible and safe use of Information

                    <p>
                        Today, cyber security has become one of the major challenges for the contemporary world due to its
                        complex technology and politics. For instance, the mass penetration of social media influence in our
                        daily lives has laid the fine groundwork for cybercriminals to engage in illegal and inauthentic
                        activities across social media platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since early 2020, even more, children have begun to spend time on the Internet—for learning,
                        socialisation, and entertainment—as a result of the widespread lockdowns and school closures that
                        were implemented by governments to contain the pandemic outbreak.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For instance, The UK-based watchdog, Internet Watch Foundation, has observed that 2021 was the
                        worst year on record for child sexual abuse online. Besides this, in Australia, there was a steep 90%
                        increase in online illegal content between 2019 and 2020, the bulk of it consisting of sexually explicit
                        online content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is the mass popularity of the Internet amongst young users that have made the implementation of
                        cyber safety strategies a herculean task. These strategies have focused on personal risks and
                        protective policies, but somehow, due to the vastness of the monitoring field, the threats are more
                        severe to master.

                    <h2>Cyber Threats to Youth</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the reasons why internet threats are looming around the youth is the recent shift to online
                        schooling and course learning, the use of educational apps, and the increased use of social media
                        have been found to pose threats to online safety.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This has inevitably led to children being more vulnerable and open to any form of digital threat like
                        online abuse and bullying.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to media reports, in April 2020 the National Commission for Women (NCW) wrote to the
                        Director General of Police in Gujarat after someone hacked into an online class run by a university
                        and began behaving inappropriately on the screen. In another incident, a Delhi-based school girl was
                        extorted for ransom from a cyberbully who threatened to release her sensitive images around the
                        school group chat.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All these incidents are not so isolated anymore as they are becoming more mainstream as we speak
                        and need urgent redressal from the authorities.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the rise of social media is quite known all around and dominates in the recent developments
                        in cyber safety specifically for young people, there are other aspects that effectively pose a great
                        challenge to online safety.

                                    and communication building. With more youngsters on the forefront, recent data suggest
                                    25-49 years olds are the most addictive users of social media.

                                    One of the greatest achievements of the internet is the
                                    introduction of social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook in the lives of
                                    people. They are enjoyed not just for communication boost but to gather traction in genres
                                    of business, personal development, global issues, etc. However, social media has exposed
                                    millions of users, especially young kids to the threat of cyberbullying, digital fraud, sexual
                                    solicitation etc.

                        The closing down of schools during the Covid-19 pandemic meant a complete reliance on online
                        teaching for students to ensure that formal education remained as little disrupted as possible.
                        Simultaneously, remaining at home for extended periods of time meant that children were spending
                        more and more time online, for socialisation and entertainment.

                    <p>
                        Cyber safety is something that needs to be addressed in parallel with the changing trends in
                        technology. It should be taken as a transformative backdrop of social media trends, products and
                        practices and the fact that this technology will keep on changing and integrating into our everyday
                        lives, the strategies and solutions must be flexible and adaptable.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to a recent study by UNESCO,62% of digital users have no idea that they were being
                        cyberbullied. This makes it all the more significant to inculcate important regulations and guidelines
                        beyond the academic sphere, especially during and after the pandemic.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Schools and universities alone cannot undertake the digital safety and cyber security habits dialogue.
                        It is the responsibility of every authority figure like parents, teachers, and governments to collaborate
                        with organisations and NGOs and impart knowledge on the issue of cyber safety amongst the youth
                        of today.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The need of the hour for cyber safety is to embrace solid strategies and solutions that promote
                        digital inclusion, digital literacy and digital resilience.

                        <p>
                            A strong resolute ability or resilience to deal with any negative experience online or offline is called
                            digital resilience. Explicit cyber security solutions conventionally focus on external protections like
                            parental monitoring, institutional laws, policy enforcement, etc
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, by contrast, digital resilience concentrates more towards a strength-based approach
                            towards cyber safety which consists of internal protective measures like social literacy,
                            self-regulation, etc.

                        <p>
                            The role of the government is foremost in cyber security strategising. If the government cannot
                            provide safe and secure digital connectivity, societies and economies will not be able to prosper as
                            well as citizens’ development will be at risk.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus, it is crucial to develop national-level defensive strategies to combat cyber safety risks. For
                            instance, in India, creating a ‘cyber-secure nation’ for citizens is a key component in the country’s
                            cybersecurity strategy. Under this idea, there are various government-led initiatives and policies at
                            work to promote cyber security.

                            Since parents and teachers have a significant influence on the impressionable minds of children and
