        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Empowering women is very important today to improve a nation's overall
          development. In simple terms, woman empowerment can be defined as
          promoting women’s sense of self-worth, their capacity to form their
          own choice and their right to influence social change for themselves
          and others. <br />
          In older times, in every corner of the world, women still face
          challenges and threats to their lives, health and wellness and as a
          result, they feel burdened. Also, due to less education and
          representation in social roles, their voices somehow go unnoticed.{" "}
          <br />
          Times are changing now, women are becoming more independent, fierce
          and skilled to influence real change in terms of the growth and
          development of society. For instance, Falguni Nayar became one of the
          most successful woman billionaires with her beauty and retail company,
          ‘Nykka’ with a net worth of 230 crores USD (in 2023). <br />
          Countries around the world like India have initiated multiple schemes
          and campaigns for the upliftment and development of women like ‘Beti
          Bachao, Beti Padao’, Mahila Shakti Kendra, etc. Apart from this,
          global platforms like United Nations and G20 acknowledge woman
          empowerment and education as a serious consideration and work
          tenaciously for the betterment of the female faction. Some initiatives
          by the UN include: ‘He for She’ campaign, the Spotlight initiative,
          etc.
        </p>
        <h3 className="fs-2"> Education & Skill Development</h3>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Women’s education is one of the foremost means for empowering women to
          become knowledgeable, skilled and self-confident to fully participate
          in the country’s development process. Providing access to proper
          education is a milestone on the path of woman’s empowerment because it
          enables them to respond to challenges, understand their roles and
          change their lives for the better. <br /> It is the responsibility of
          the governmental authorities to identify and acknowledge and promote
          measures that fulfil all girls’ and women’s potential through
          education and proper skill development. The intention should be to
          eradicate the illiteracy of women without any discrimination. Civil
          societies can collaborate with the governments to ensure universal
          access of education, and healthcare on the basis of equality for women
          throughout their lives. <br />
          The Constitution of India for instance has certain provisions that
          specifically focus on women’s empowerment and prevents discrimination
          against women in society. Article 14 talks about equality before the
          law and Article 15 enables the state to make special provisions for
          women. <br /> In view of that take a look at the following schemes and
          initiatives undertaken by the government of India towards women’s
          education and skill development <br />

            Gender equity talks about treating men and women in fairness. To
            ensure that, measures and strategies must be made available for any
            kind of discrimination and disadvantage women face while operating
            with men in the same field. Equity leads to equality. Gender
            equality requires an absolute balance between men and women in terms
            of social development, opportunities, education and other factors.{" "}
            <br />
            Similarly, having good knowledge, confidence, and awareness of
            gender equity are part of the women empowerment process. These
            factors are well developed through education since an educated woman
            is aware of her rights and thus cannot be discriminated in society.{" "}

          <p>
            Women play a key role in the labour force or economic development of
            the country. However, it is seen often that their role is isolated
            and forgotten in the larger framework of economic growth. The role
            played by women as women business entrepreneurs or decent employees
            is a major instrument of women empowerment that needs to be
            accepted. <br />
            Besides, achieving gender equality and women’s economic empowerment
            is vital not only from a women’s rights perspective but also for
            smart economics. As global economies grow faster when gender equity
            is advanced, fewer people are in poverty and the overall well-being
            of a nation increases. <br />
            According to a report in Washington Post, around 54 million women
            globally were forced to leave their work during the first year of
            the Covid-19 pandemic. <br />

          <p>
            {" "}
            According to a report by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
            Development (OECD), today almost 327 million fewer women compared to
            men have access to internet and smartphone. Not only this, but
            Women-owned start-ups receive 23% less funding and are 30% less
            likely to have a positive exit compared to male-owned businesses.{" "}
            <br />
            These numbers are both shocking and unfortunate, especially in the
            digitally transformative environment of today. This digital gender
            divide needs to be tackled with coordinated efforts from all
            economies. <br />
            Issues like affordability, lack of education, and sociocultural
            norms prohibit women and girls to benefit from the opportunities
            that come from digital transformation. Moreover, their limited usage
            of digital tools and scarce presence on digital platforms especially
