          For any country, its youth population plays a key role in the overall
          growth, development and possible advancements. It is the youth of
          today that has the potential to become leaders, inventors, and
          innovators for tomorrow as they have the power to bring big change if
          their energies are put to good use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indian youth in recent times have shown great interest and calibre in
          the advancements of India in fields like technology, business,
          entertainment, science and more. Besides, when the youth are receiving
          a good education and getting employed, generating incomes rather than
          being dependent on others, the country’s economy sees a positive surge
          too.
        </p>
        <p>
          International forums like the G20 have identified and accepted the
          youth’s role and responsibilities towards bringing global change.
          Similarly, the platform has created a youth-centric engagement group
          called Youth20 or Y20.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Y20 group allows young leaders across the globe to discuss and
          negotiate worldly matters and suggest valuable suggestions for the G20
          leaders to take forward. Under India’s G20 presidency for 2023, the
          Y20 summit will be hosted by India and the key focus will be on global
          youth leadership and partnership.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the themes for the Y20 India summit is “Shared Future: Youth in
          Democracy and Governance.” Take a look at the forthwith section to
          understand how youth can play an important role in realising that
          shared future dream.

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Youth in Legislature and Politics</h4>
        <p>
          According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, 2 out of 3 countries do not
          consult young people as a part of the process of preparing poverty reduction strategies or national
          development plans. Not only this but they are mostly underrepresented by formal political
          institutions even though the political decisions impact their lives
        </p>
        <p>
          Meaningful democracies require meaningful participation from the young
          factions of society. The youth with their fresh ideas and objective
          opinions have a lot to offer- from creative thinking to revolutionary
          action-taking. So, their participation in democracy will promote
          social responsibility, and enhance political institutions functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Young men and women of today are key drivers for inclusive and progressive growth and sustainable
          development. When these people are actively engaged and empowered in legislative
          decision-making, societies shall be more cohesive, and resilient and the democracies will become
          more vibrant.

        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, today’s young minds are tomorrow’s leaders and
          decision-makers, so their participation and engagement in legislature
          and politics are all the more crucial in the long run.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guiding principle for effective youth political participation must be, ‘nothing about us without
          us.’ So, all strategies to enhance their role in politics must be grounded in a rights-based approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i><b>Take at the following similar principles that occur when having good engagement from youth to
            foster effective youth participation in politics:
          </b></i>
        </p>
        <ul className="row row-cols-1  row-cols-md-2">
          <li>
            <h3>Transparency</h3>
            <p>
              This means having a crystal clear flow of the process of the purpose of youth
              participation and engagement whether it is youth-led or organisation-led collaboration.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Innovation and Flexibility</h3>
            <p>
              This means having solid commitments from young people and
              adults side to be open to new ideas and willing to undertake risks and challenge the existing
              political processes and structures
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Accountability</h3>
            <p>
              This means having proper mechanisms in place to ensure follow-ups,
              implementation of youth ideas and accountability to constituencies. It majorly requires
              young people to take an active role in monitoring and establishing channels where youth
              participation in democratic events has proper visibility.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>
              Sustainability of financial resources for best-practice youth engagement
              initiatives can help to ensure these are not limited or one-off events or processes. Successful
              youth engagement leads to decision-makers seeking youth involvement and leadership in
              addressing challenges and designing solutions.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Capacity oriented </h3>
            <p>
              This means solidifying youth faction by supporting their capability
              developments via networks, movements, youth organisations to enhance mutual
              transparency, trust and contribution.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Relevant and Purposeful</h3>
            <p>
              Activities to enhance youth political participation should be as
              youth-driven as possible. Young people themselves can decide on their priorities, methods,
              and tactics. It means young people take on valued roles, addressing issues that are relevant
              to them, and influencing real outcomes. To be relevant, they can link to specific concerns of
              youth such as unemployment, climate change, digital transformation, pandemic work
              culture, etc.

          India is known to be the world’s largest democratic nation with more
          than half of the population between the age groups of 18-35 years.
          This somewhat sums up the point of highlighting how big of an asset
          India’s youth is and can be to its democratic structure.

          However, every initiative has its shortcomings as well, so engaging
          youth in politics can be challenging as young people tend to have
          fickle minds and dwindling interests in political scenes, especially
          towards politicians and party ideologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a youth stocktaking report by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
          Development (OECD), in 17 out of 35 OECD member countries, young people express lesser trust in
          governments than in their parents. It signals from the frustration with the present outdated channels
          to make their voices heard in the political sphere.

        </p>
        <p>
          Also, the significant share of political disengagement is vital as around 25% of 15-29 years old stress
          that they are not ‘ interested in politics.’
        </p>
        <p>
          Youth feel directionless and often marginalised from
          mainstream activities, which is a threat to democracy. The best
          solution can be to offer more youth involvement in international
          campaigns and challenging activities that make them feel heard and
          part of the decision-making process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, political leaders must involve youth in democratic
          marches and share responsibilities to build partnerships with them.
          This way, youth can be a better asset to the thriving democratic
          alliance between government and citizens.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Youth in Policy Making and Governance</h4>
        <blockquote>
          Mere good governance is not enough; it has to be pro-people and
          pro-active. Good governance is putting people at the centre of
          development process <br />
          <span>-PM Narendra Modi</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Historically, good governance is defined as a governing system that
          upholds the fundamentals of laid policies with equality, liberty and
          fraternity as guiding principles. Good governance plays a key role in
          the social, cultural and economic development of society and ensures
          social security and positive change.
        </p>
        <p>
          India, for instance, harbours the world’s greatest youth workforce
          under 30 years of age and constitutes almost 75% of the country’s
          population. Hence youth’s role in policy-making and governance by
          bringing about a change can have a greater influence on the country’s
          developmental process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, every nation needs to empower its youth so that they may contribute to society and the
          economy. This undertaking needs a clear and comprehensive vision that is backed by a sound
          strategy, and a specific action plan that guides youth-related policies, services and programmes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be done by formulating a youth policy. A foremost public policy that acts as a framework o
          shape the vision for youth as well as builds a repertoire for good governance for the lawmakers.
          There are various examples of national strategies and policies that focus on young people’s
          participation in policy and governance like
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5 py-3">
          <li className="py-2">
            1. <b>Slovak Republic’s National Youth Strategy</b> (2014-2020) provides a cross-sectorial approach
            and focuses on nine policy areas including education, employment, health,
            entrepreneurship, social inclusion and volunteering. The strategy underlines investment and
            empowerment as its key pillars while placing an emphasis on the labour migration of
            educated young Slovaks to other countries
          </li>
          <li className="py-2">
            2. <b>In Ireland, a national strategy on LGBTI+ youth</b> (2018-2020) has been developed to create a
            more supportive and inclusive environment for LGBTI+ young people.
          </li>
          <li className="py-2">
            3. <b>In Gaia, Portugal the municipal corporation has prepared a municipal youth plan</b> to enable
            public policies fostering equal opportunities and social cohesion; and to implement local
            youth policies in an open collaborative manner.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, it also needs to be understood well that just formulating such strategies by the government
          isn’t enough. They need to ensure that these policies are evidence-based, transparent, accountable
          and properly executed. Adequate resources as well as sound monitoring and evaluation mechanisms
          are critical to translating youth commitments into tangible outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, COVID-19 has increased already high levels of uncertainty for youth due to global
          transformations that have significantly affected their access to decent jobs, affordable education and
          housing, and opportunities to participate in public and political life. Thus, youth participation and representation globally in policy-making
          institutions have always been relatively low.
        </p>
        <p>
          People under the age of
          35 are seldom seen taking active roles in public administration,
          parliamentary sessions or any governing committees on economic growth
          and development. This issue needs to be addressed more sequentially
          and with proper consideration to know why it matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the ways to ensure youth’s attention and engagement in the
          governance of a nation are:

          So, now more than ever, the youth’s role in community governance must
          be realised with proper role-sharing and participation. They are the
          echoing voices and opinions the government must listen to in order to
          frame a suitable globalised solution to fight the causes like climate
          change, recession, global warming, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          There can be some ways in which youth engagement in community
          governance can be undertaken by the authorities like:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-group border-none  mt-3">
          <li className="list-group-item border-0  ps-0">
            <span className="p-2 bg-primary clip-cicle text-white mt-2">
              <i className="bi bi-arrow-right"></i>
            </span>{" "}
            <span className="ps-2 fs-5">
              <b>Having stable funding for youth participation</b> as it is
              crucial to support community-based youth organisations as they are
              the prime catalysts for young people and their civic life in
              communities.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li className="list-group-item border-0  ps-0">
            <span className="p-2 bg-primary clip-cicle text-white mt-2">
              <i className="bi bi-arrow-right"></i>
            </span>{" "}
            <span className="ps-2 fs-5">
              <b>Optimum public awareness for youth engagement practices</b> as
              society’s view of the youth remains stereotypical and limited.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li className="list-group-item border-0  ps-0">
            <span className="p-2 bg-primary clip-cicle text-white mt-2">
              <i className="bi bi-arrow-right"></i>
            </span>{" "}
            <span className="ps-2 fs-5">
              <b>
                Building and supporting youth training and outreach programmes
              </b>{" "}
              organised by local communities, non-profit organisations, etc. as
              they are well-paced to influence stakeholders, governing bodies
              and political leaders.
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Lastly, it is equally important to broaden the scientific context for
          youth engagement within community governance. The skill, value and
          power that youth bring to the governance and how their voice can bring
          in monumental shifts in a country’s future goals is somewhat
          underestimated still.
