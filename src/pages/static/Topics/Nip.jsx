        <h3>New Education Policy (NEP) 2020</h3>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          The Union cabinet brought about transformative reform in the school
          and higher education system by launching the New National Education
          Policy (NEP) on 29th July 2020. MHRD was also renamed as the Ministry
          of Education. After the old national education policy which was
          launched back in 1986, this is the first education policy of the 21st
          century that has changed the primitive teaching styles that have been
          followed for the last 34 years. India students will now find a
          distinctive new learning model where they are challenged and taught
          new things. In this new policy, there will be a 5+3+3+4 structure
          which comprises 12 years of school and 3 years of Anganwadi/pre-school
          replacing the old 10+2 structure.The National Education Policy that
          was submitted by the Kasturirangan Committee. The education policy’s
          main agenda was to address the key challenges faced by the existing
          education system. Some of the important points raised by the committee
          was :
        </p>
        <h6>1. Quality</h6>
        <h6>2. Affordability</h6>
        <h6>3. Equity</h6>
        <h6>4. Access</h6>
        <h6>5. Accountability</h6>
        <p className="text-dark">
          The policy provides for reforms at all levels of education from school
          to higher education.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark">
          ● Focus on strengthening teacher training. <br />
          ● Reforming the existing exam system <br />
          ● Early childhood care and restructuring the regulatory framework of
          education. <br />
          Other recommendations of the NEP include: <br /> ● Increasing public
          investment in education. <br />
          ● Setting up the NEC (National Education Commission). <br />
          ● Increasing focus on vocational and adult education. <br />
          ● Strengthening the use of technology, etc. <br />
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          Through this new education scheme, the ministry is trying to bring
          more than 2 crore students into the mainstream and they aim to achieve
          100 % GER (Gross enrollment ratio) from pre-school to higher secondary
          by the end of 2030. Through this NEP 2020 the government is looking
          forward to making India a “global knowledge superpower” and it will be
          only done by making the education system for schools and colleges more
          flexible, holistic, and multi-disciplinary which will bring out their
          unique capabilities. The NEP envisions an India centred education
          system that directly contributes to the evolution of building the
          nation into an equitable and vibrant knowledge society by giving them
          a top-class quality of education. It is more inclusive and accessible
          for students from all socio backgrounds.

        <h4>Education in G20</h4>
        <p className="text-dark">
          As India takes over the presidency of G20 for the year 2030, one of
          the major priorities of the summit is education. Dharmendra Pradhan,
          honourable Education minister quoted the importance of education in
          the summit. Further, the minister said that India will present a new
          template of education which can be a global model for all emerging
          economies. For the grand success of the summit, students, educational
          and skilling institutions will be involved. It will be a joint venture
          where each and everyone is a participant and equally involved. The
          minister also suggested showcasing the rich heritage of the Indian
          school of knowledge and making participants aware of the contribution
          of India to the world. The committee will be holding seminars on the
          role of digital technology in education and TVET (technical and
          vocational education and training) and the future of work, leading to
          a meeting of G20 education ministers on June 28, 2023. As per reports,
          the 'Education Working Group' will be releasing a G20 EdWG report,
          compendium of best practices and a report on the two seminar themes
          leading to the G20 Education Ministers' declaration. Institutions like
          NCERT, IISC, NSDC, IIT Madras, IIT Hyderabad, Ministry of Skill
          Development and Entrepreneurship, UNESCO, UNICEF, OECD, etc are
          knowledge partners under various priority areas and will be the major
          venues. The NEP is India's guiding light for promoting lifelong
          learning opportunities and achieving the shared vision of G20.
          Dharmender Pradhan said India is laying special emphasis on
          formalizing early childhood care and education, supporting
          differently-abled children, boosting digital and multi-modal learning,
          flexible entry-exit pathways, integrating education with skills, which
          are keys to improve learning outcomes. India has operationalised
          virtual schools and is in the process of setting up Digital university
          and over 260 channels dedicated to education in multiple Indian
          languages to expand the realm of education and also for achieving the
          goal of making education equitable and accessible,” he said. The
          Education Minister quoted that the NEP has paved the way for
          internationalisation of education in India and the country is
          welcoming foreign universities to set campuses in GIFT City. He also
          said that they are in the process of bringing policy measures for
          allowing foreign universities to set up their campus across India.
          This will bring changes in the migration pattern of students moving
          abroad for higher education. Post-covid there has been a huge increase
          in students leaving the country. India’s commitment is to work
          together with G20 member states to establish an education system where
          learning outcomes match 21st century skills. For education to be the
          driver of global growth, all efforts should be made to harness the
          full potential of our G20 Education Working Group,” he further added.
