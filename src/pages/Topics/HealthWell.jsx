          Young people’s involvement in various sectors and divisions of
          governance can be immensely useful. Some institutions emphasise more
          on youth participation as a basic right if the intent of their work is
          towards young people’s welfare.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other end, youth involvement and engagement are often seen as a
          means to achieve programme goals for communities as well as nations.
          For instance, many countries engaged young people in Covid-19 recovery
          efforts through national civic services and youth volunteering
          programmes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This showed how young people were vital in ensuring transparency and
          continuity of daily activities specifically for Covid-stricken
          vulnerable groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          International forums like the G20 have identified and accepted the
          youth’s role and responsibilities towards bringing global change.
          Similarly, the platform has created a youth-centric engagement group
          called Youth20 or Y20.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Y20 group allows young leaders across the globe to discuss and
          negotiate worldly matters and suggest valuable suggestions for the G20
          leaders to take forward. Under India’s G20 presidency for 2023, the
          Y20 summit will be hosted by India and the key focus will be on global
          youth leadership and partnership.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the themes for the Y20 India summit is “Health, Well-Being, and
          Sports: Agenda for Youth.” Take a look at the forthwith section to
          understand the relevance of young people in the sphere of health
          infrastructure, complete wellness, and sports development.

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Promoting Digital Health Infrastructure</h4>
        <p>
          Since the outbreak of Covid-19, healthcare delivery systems and
          infrastructures have undergone rapid transformation. Many global
          governments have largely focused their efforts on younger populations
          to address their education, employment and upskilling challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to OECD Covid Recovery Report 2022, the majority of the
          Covid responses have been towards creating reasonable measures for
          young people in policy-making areas of mental and physical healthcare,
          digitalisation, leisure and sports, etc. Digital healthcare
          innovations have accelerated even though supporting infrastructure
          investments are still meagre
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking hints from the global pandemic crisis and continuous economic
          upheaval, institutions need to create an optimal healthcare platform
          that brings various elements together to build digital infrastructure.
          This would allow them to embrace newer opportunities, deploy
          well-planned infrastructure in public networks, and engage with the
          right people who help determine specific digital priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, in India, the launch of the Ayushmaan Bharat Digital
          Health Mission (ABHM) by Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has triggered a
          potential digital transformation in the healthcare industry. The
          Mission’s USP lies in the new features like electronic medical records
          (EMRs) and unique health IDs for all citizens that would strengthen
          the backbone of the nation’s healthcare infrastructure. The EMR
          sharing will bring ease in data capturing and data transfer for the
          patients whereas it would allow data security and confidentiality for
          the doctors if the records are rolled out using blockchain technology
        </p>
        <p>
          According to National Health Authority in India, almost 1,92,764
          health facilities are registered, 11,82,790 health records are
          downloaded, and 1195 active integrators are recorded in the new ABHM
          scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Promoting digital transformation in healthcare will help make
          healthcare more accessible and affordable. Spreading digital literacy
          and significant governance schemes via youth-centric awareness
          programmes will bridge the gap between doctors and patients. Boosting
          telemedicine and adopting other digital health aspects in delivery
          systems will help in integrating diagnostic chains, pharmacies, labs,
          etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new wave of smart solutions like Covid tracking apps like
          Aarogya-Setu and vaccination apps like CoWin by the Indian government
          is a good example to show the world that digitising the healthcare
          infrastructure will standardise the system and enforce
          interoperability.

          Complete Well-being - Physical and Mental Health through Traditional
          Medicine and Yoga
        </h4>
        <p>
          Many things have changed in the current post-pandemic existence
          especially when it comes to healthcare and wellness. Physical and
          mental health awareness have gathered much dominance over working
          opportunities. So, one of the prevalent themes for the youth of today
          is to take the narrative of complete wellness forward with government
          collaboration and community engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of WHO South-East Asia Region’s eight Flagship Priorities states
          that Yoga is a powerful tool for individuals, communities and
          countries to improve not only physical but also mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, inculcating yoga in day-to-day lives will help millions
          of people to stay active, healthy and well, which is important to stay
          on par with the rapidly changing social and economic environment
        </p>
        <p>
          Changing lifestyles is another significant derivative to consider when
          it comes to wellness. Since the earth has limited resources to support
          the massive needs of 8 billion people, it’s only natural to be smart
          and choose sustainable options like recycling clothes, avoiding water,
          and electricity wastage, etc. to mitigate further escalation of
          damaging the planet’s ecosystem.

          Improving Access to Health Financing for Young Citizens
        </h4>
        <p>
          According to the State of the Blended Finance Report 2022, the
          sustainable development goals (SDGs) financial gap was 2.5 trillion
          USD before Covid-19 and surged to 1.7 trillion USD due to
          Covid-19-related financial requirements. This also exposed the
          drawbacks in the healthcare division and raised the need for proper
          health financing solutions and increased healthcare capacity
          infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent times, many global communities have aimed to achieve
          universal health for their people. Several global institutions and
          leaders have worked tirelessly to strive for a future where ‘all
          individuals and communities have access to quality healthcare.’
        </p>
        <p>
          However, young people are somehow missed from these conversations.
          There is a lack of proper healthcare policies and interventions that
          cater to youth’s needs in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the improved health
          outcomes seen among younger factions are due to inadequate resources.”
          Achieving universal health and improving health access for young
          citizens is a task that every nation tries to work upon. So, in order
          to uphold that objective, countries can:

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Prevention of Substance Abuse </h4>
        <p>
          Substance abuse may be defined as the overindulgence in a few
          substances such as alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, prescription drugs,
          etc. in irregular patterns to satisfy abnormal mood swings. This
          substance abuse issue is a worldly matter of concern as it can
          aggravate physical and mental health fear in young people, promote
          poor peer relationships, cause accidents and surge the stress levels
          in the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost 65% of youth in America suffer from substance abuse problems.
          One of the most prevalent and highly used substances amongst youth in
          America is alcohol. They engage in unnatural drinking patterns that
          potentially lead to harmful behaviour and risky consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are multiple programs and intervention facilities available for
          the prevention of substance abuse issues. It can be within families
          and communities that provide inspiring dialogue for youth by focusing
          on environmental developmental factors
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, in India, two national-level initiatives are in place to
          address the substance abuse issue that is the Rashtriya Kishor
          Swasthya Karyakram (National Adolescent Health Policy) and the Scheme
          of Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse (SPASA).

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Promotion of Indigenous Sports</h4>
        <p>
          Today, the sports sector is becoming a significant element in a
          country’s socioeconomic development and prestige. For that to
          continue, every nation must invest in the latest technology-ridden
          infrastructure that relates to best sports practices, training,
          research and wellness throughout the sporting institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, proper policies and the implementation of robust laws to
          promote sports amongst young citizens will go a long way as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look at some of the following sports initiatives and schemes
