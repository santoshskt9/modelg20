        <p className="text-dark fs-5">

          prospects multiplies its progression exponentially. As startups in
          India is becoming more worldwide phenomenon, the Indian youth is
          continually influenced to make the most of it with active
          participation and constructive contribution.

        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Many government schemes, state initiatives, and social media platforms
          have created a well- rounded playfield for youth aspirants to
          transform their startup ideas into entrepreneurial reality.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Names like Sameer Nigam (Phonepe), Bhavish Agarwal (Ola Cabs), Vijay
          Sharma (PayTM) are perfect examples of young business entrepreneurs
          who rose from a small idea to build a brand that represents India on a
          global platform.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          It is fair to assume that with the right direction, the youth of India
          can be the most instrumental asset generator in the country and
          Startups are that direction which allows room for ideas, innovation
          and design clubbed with a business mind.
        </p>
        <h4 className="fs-2">Why Should Youth go for Startups?</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Take a look at the following reasons why youth should go for startups:
        </p>
        <h4>Culture Shift</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          There was a time when budding employers and job seekers worshipped
          established business ideals and top players of the field to set their
          merits but that is past now. Thanks to the rapid technological
          advancements, the youth has set out to seek more than age-old laid
          business models.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Many startup firms are created by people who are fresh out of college
          or still studying which makes their work culture more flexible and
          energy driven. There is no 8-9hour job routine to follow or personal
          responsibilities to deal with. So, young entrepreneurs set their goals
          and work hours at a wavelength that adheres to them and them only.
        </p>
        <h4>Best Holistic Learning</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Startups are built with small groups of members who have similar goals
          but with a unified sense of transparency. Employees learn new
          techniques, new workflows and business ethics in a more practical
          setup. It is safe to say that the youth get to experience business
          school-like precision while working with startups.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Moreover, while working in startups, one can learn more than one skill
          like marketing, customer support, team collaboration, designing, etc.
          It aptly presents holistic learning than just theoretical knowledge.
        </p>
        <h4>Fast Paced Work Environment</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          One thing that better describes the youth of today is everything needs
          to be quick and fast. Given to that, various startups are based on
          on-hand projects or jobs. Since there is not much political or
          bureaucratic influence, startups and youth can collectively work with
          more focus, passion and determination.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Besides, submissions, Ideas, and projects will get delayed, rejected
          and improved upon all within a short span which makes the business
          more prone to authentic success.
        </p>
        <h4>Bridge between Technology and People</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Big conglomerates and established businesses at times lose the scope
          of customer reach with their pre-set models. On the other hand,
          startups are nothing but creative solutions made to tackle real
          problems of real people.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          For instance, Zomato, Swiggy has erased the hunger gap between food
          suppliers and customers by becoming a responsible medium that reaches
          every corner of the country.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          So, youth can make use of such opportunities that tackle real problems
          with the technology that they like and thus become valuable assets in
          startup operations.
        </p>
        <h4>Innovation at every Step</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          One of the most prolific aspects of startups is their attribute of
          innovative thinking. Pick any Indian startup venture- Myntra, Nykaa,
          OyO Rooms, all these ideas were incubated in a small space but with
          the right direction and game plan, they became huge impactful names in
          the business.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          So, the youth of today too can bravely dare to think outside the box
          and give rise to innovative solutions to their creative idea.
        </p>
        <h4>Startups in G20 Summit</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          The Group of Twenty(G20) is a premier economic forum where leaders
          meet to discuss global economic, financial and socio-political issues
          to reach a consensus and then suggest recommendations to tackle the
          said issues in order to strengthen global architecture.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          As part of G20’s rotating presidency, India is chosen as the 2023 G20
          president nation and thus will host the 2023 Leaders summit in October
          2023.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          One of the prime initiatives under India’s 2023 G20 presidency is
          Startups. According to Indian Sherpa, Amitabh Kant,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “When we started the Startup India movement, there were just about
          200- odd startups. Today we have 80,000 plus startups and 106 unicorns
          so we are going to use this to see how the startup movement can be
          accelerated among G20.”
          <p className="mb-0">
            by <span className="text-primary">Amitabh Kant</span>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          As startups are instrumental groups between technology and economic
          development, it’s only fair that as an emerging nation with super-fast
          digital growth, India is carrying forward the discourse to the global
          level.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Under the engagement group title, Startup20, India hopes to highlight
          the nation’s startup movement and how digital transformation has
          played a key role in its fast-paced success. It also would recommend
          actions, and relative measures to foster collaboration and innovations
          across G20 leaders during the summit.
