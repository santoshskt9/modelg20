                    According to the World Economic Forum's 2018 Future of Jobs Report, ubiquitous high-speed
                    mobile Internet, artificial intelligence, big data analytics adoption, and cloud technology are just
                    a few of the change-drivers that could result in the demand for new skills and the need for
                    continuous learning for the entire workforce, regardless of their industry or domain. Only 20% of
                    employees presently possess the skills necessary to succeed in their current and future job
                    responsibilities, according to market research firm Gartner. In a different recent survey, young
                    people indicated they were generally 43 percent convinced that they would need to retrain and
                    had the skills to do so.

                    Global megatrends including technology, climate change, demographic shifts, urbanization, and
                    global value chains are all changing the nature of the workforce and the skills that are in demand.

                </p>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the entire working world, making it as
                    unpredictable as it can be. Businesses in a variety of industries have been advised to function
                    remotely and quickly adopt the new working practices. It is now more important than ever for
                    leaders to guide their enterprises and the entire workforce through the uncertainty that hangs over
                    the entire ecosystem. Leaders of today and tomorrow must abide by the maxim "Learn, Unlearn,
                    and Relearn" in order to successfully manage the intricacies of the business environment in the
                    present and the future as it becomes more uncertain.

                    In January 2020, The World Economic Forum issued a warning: "The world is facing a reskilling
                    emergency. By 2030, more than 1 billion people need to upgrade their skills. The basic idea was
                    that for people to not be left behind, organizations, governments, and society must work together.
                    Reskilling, upskilling, and outskilling, present the solution to these issues, but learning as we
                    currently know it will not be sufficient, as many chief learning officers and L&D teams have
                    already realized. There is a need for a learning transformation that focuses on the relationship
                    between ongoing re/up/outskilling and productive work: They represent the two sides of one
                    coin. To prepare for a superlearning future that is focused on skills and capabilities at the
                    individual, team, and organizational levels, powered by data, and integrates "learning in the flow
                    of work" across functions and businesses, L&D teams must overcome a number of challenges.

                <p>
                    Making this change entails a journey with a number of deliberate steps, and the only place to
                    begin is at the beginning. The result is a "super" workforce that is resilient and flexible to both
                    present and impending disruptions.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The epidemic has recently caused disruptions in the worldwide labour market. Upskilling is the
                    only way someone might withstand such a significant change in industry needs. Fortunately, the
                    changing nature of the workforce has created new opportunities, making upskilling essential. In
                    2022, 79% of professionals (including recent graduates) intend to improve their skill sets. New
                    fields like blockchain, cybersecurity, Web 3.0, and NFTs have made upskilling more important.
                    According to professionals who want to upskill in 2022, the top five industries are education &
                    training, banking, information technology, healthcare, and consulting. A rise in digital
                    transformation has led to a continued dominance of the BFSI, IT, and consulting sectors.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The process of establishing an upskilling culture within an organization is being undertaken by a
                    number of organizations. Only 35% of workers believe that their firm now provides training
                    programmes. These initiatives produce an extremely effective staff for the company.
                    Organizations are putting more of an emphasis on helping their workforce reach its full potential
                    and rounding out the workforce with knowledge outside of their major areas of professional
                    expertise as a result of the renewed emphasis on preparing employees with skill sets for the
                    future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professionals will perform better in their roles and advance more swiftly with upskilling. It
                    promotes rapid progress and a fulfilling career. Technological advancements increase
                    productivity, lower error rates, and simplify tasks. Professionals can perform well by aligning
                    their jobs with corporate goals by upskilling to these technology solutions. In addition to helping
                    professionals achieve their job goals, upskilling also fosters confidence. Having a broad
                    knowledge base and learning new topics increase one's self-esteem.

                    It is generally acknowledged that the present and upcoming generations of workers are:
                </p>
                <ol className='fs-5 mb-4'>
                    <li>
                        1.  independently motivated;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2.  intelligent and tech-savvy.
                    </li>
                    <li>3.  The need to engage in oneself again</li>
                    <li>4.  Look for ways to gain an advantage with modern technology</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    So, the responsibility falls on companies to learn to be agile and stay relevant to help employees
                    upskill. Encouragement of microlearning is one method for keeping staff on a growth cycle in a
                    hectic setting. Employee training that is brief and to the point is called microlearning. Training
                    content is more likely to be remembered when it is delivered in manageable chunks at the
                    appropriate time. A significant boost comes from developing internal talent for leadership
                    positions to future-proof your work force.

                    The actions to take when upskilling are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul className='fs-5 mb-4'>
                    <li>
                        ● Determine the abilities you need to acquire — The first step is to determine the skill gap
                        you are attempting to fill. Whether you want to change careers, get promoted, or apply
                        for a new job, you'll need to have a few specialized abilities or certifications.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ● Watch for educational opportunities — As a working professional, it would be great if
                        you kept an eye out for part-time educational options. Taking full-time classes in a
                        classroom or enrolling in online certification programmes are alternative alternatives.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ● Use online resources — Upskilling shouldn't necessarily be expensive, especially if you
                        choose entry-level courses. Make the most of the available free internet resources to
                        better grasp the field before enrolling in more expensive, advanced courses. To learn
                        more about your field, you may register for newsletters, follow industry professionals on
                        social media, and subscribe to blogs.

                </ul>

                <h4>The bottom line</h4>
                <p>
                    The emphasis is gradually changing from Scale to Skill as additional employment opportunities
                    emerge in the IT sector. Technical skills that are compatible with the digital economy are
                    consequently highly sought after. The moment has come to test the waters and catch the fresh
                    wave. Re-skill or perish is the only way forward
