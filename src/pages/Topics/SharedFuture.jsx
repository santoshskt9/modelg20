          For any country, its youth population plays a key role in the overall
          growth, development and possible advancements. It is the youth of
          today that has the potential to become leaders, inventors, and
          innovators for tomorrow as they have the power to bring big change if
          their energies are put to good use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indian youth in recent times have shown great interest and calibre in
          the advancements of India in fields like technology, business,
          entertainment, science and more. Besides, when the youth are receiving
          a good education and getting employed, generating incomes rather than
          being dependent on others, the country’s economy sees a positive surge
          too.
        </p>
        <p>
          International forums like the G20 have identified and accepted the
          youth’s role and responsibilities towards bringing global change.
          Similarly, the platform has created a youth-centric engagement group
          called Youth20 or Y20.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Y20 group allows young leaders across the globe to discuss and
          negotiate worldly matters and suggest valuable suggestions for the G20
          leaders to take forward. Under India’s G20 presidency for 2023, the
          Y20 summit will be hosted by India and the key focus will be on global
          youth leadership and partnership.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the themes for the Y20 India summit is “Shared Future: Youth in
          Democracy and Governance.” Take a look at the forthwith section to
          understand how youth can play an important role in realising that
          shared future dream.

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Youth in Legislature and Politics</h4>
        <p>
          Meaningful democracies require meaningful participation from the young
          factions of society. The youth with their fresh ideas and objective
          opinions have a lot to offer- from creative thinking to revolutionary
          action-taking. So, their participation in democracy will promote
          social responsibility, and enhance political institutions functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, today’s young minds are tomorrow’s leaders and
          decision-makers, so their participation and engagement in legislature
          and politics are all the more crucial in the long run.
        </p>
        <p>
          India is known to be the world’s largest democratic nation with more
          than half of the population between the age groups of 18-35 years.
          This somewhat sums up the point of highlighting how big of an asset
          India’s youth is and can be to its democratic structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b className="text-uppercase">Fun Fact:</b> In one-third of countries
          of the world, 25 years is the average age to take part in national
          parliaments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Engaging the youth in legislative events and political participation
          can have multiple positive implications:

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, every initiative has its shortcomings as well, so engaging
          youth in politics can be challenging as young people tend to have
          fickle minds and dwindling interests in political scenes, especially
          towards politicians and party ideologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, they still feel directionless and often marginalised from
          mainstream activities, which is a threat to democracy. The best
          solution can be to offer more youth involvement in international
          campaigns and challenging activities that make them feel heard and
          part of the decision-making process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, political leaders must involve youth in democratic
          marches and share responsibilities to build partnerships with them.
          This way, youth can be a better asset to the thriving democratic
          alliance between government and citizens.

        <h4 className="mt-4 fs-3">Youth in Policy Making and Governance</h4>
        <blockquote>
          Mere good governance is not enough; it has to be pro-people and
          pro-active. Good governance is putting people at the centre of
          development process <br />
          <span>-PM Narendra Modi</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Historically, good governance is defined as a governing system that
          upholds the fundamentals of laid policies with equality, liberty and
          fraternity as guiding principles. Good governance plays a key role in
          the social, cultural and economic development of society and ensures
          social security and positive change.
        </p>
        <p>
          India, for instance, harbours the world’s greatest youth workforce
          under 30 years of age and constitutes almost 75% of the country’s
          population. Hence youth’s role in policy-making and governance by
          bringing about a change can have a greater influence on the country’s
          developmental process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Youth participation and representation globally in policy-making
          institutions have always been relatively low. People under the age of
          35 are seldom seen taking active roles in public administration,
          parliamentary sessions or any governing committees on economic growth
          and development. This issue needs to be addressed more sequentially
          and with proper consideration to know why it matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the ways to ensure youth’s attention and engagement in the
          governance of a nation are:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-group border-none  mt-3">
          <li className="list-group-item border-0  ps-0">

            </span>{" "}
            <span className="ps-2 fs-5">
              <b>Having inclusive and active political</b> participation during

              so they adequately understand the policy-making process,
              governance structure and political ideologies in a more meaningful
              sense.

              <b>Investing in new technologies and resources</b> to attract more
              youth towards national and international campaigns. For instance,
              the Indian government’s Digital India campaign portals like
              ‘mygov.in’ connects their government and citizens under the
              universal brotherhood

          Institutionalising Leadership and Governance Training
        </h4>
        <p>
          Times have changed and young people have become more self-aware and
          active agents of change for the world. They are taking part in rallies
          and boycotts, movements against the authoritarian regime,
          inequalities, injustice, etc. They are even readily participating to
          fight for the sustainable development cause and strive for a better
          future within communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, now more than ever, the youth’s role in community governance must
          be realised with proper role-sharing and participation. They are the
          echoing voices and opinions the government must listen to in order to
          frame a suitable globalised solution to fight the causes like climate
          change, recession, global warming, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          There can be some ways in which youth engagement in community
          governance can be undertaken by the authorities like:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-group border-none  mt-3">
          <li className="list-group-item border-0  ps-0">

              <i className="bi bi-arrow-right"></i>
            </span>{" "}
            <span className="ps-2 fs-5">
              <b>Having stable funding for youth participation</b> as it is
              crucial to support community-based youth organisations as they are
              the prime catalysts for young people and their civic life in
              communities.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li className="list-group-item border-0  ps-0">
            <span className="p-2 bg-primary clip-cicle text-white mt-2">

            </span>{" "}
            <span className="ps-2 fs-5">
              <b>Optimum public awareness for youth engagement practices</b> as
              society’s view of the youth remains stereotypical and limited.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li className="list-group-item border-0  ps-0">
            <span className="p-2 bg-primary clip-cicle text-white mt-2">

            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Lastly, it is equally important to broaden the scientific context for
          youth engagement within community governance. The skill, value and
          power that youth bring to the governance and how their voice can bring
          in monumental shifts in a country’s future goals is somewhat
          underestimated still.
