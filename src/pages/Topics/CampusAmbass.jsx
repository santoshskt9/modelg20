        <h3>G20 Campus Sherpa Programme</h3>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5 mb-3">
          In line with the Model G20 Programme on our website G20-india.org, we
          want to engage enthusiastic youth from schools, colleges and
          universities to become 'Campus Sherpa'. Each institution will have one
          campus ambassador who will volunteer to undertake a set of activities
          to promote, manage and execute Model G20 Programmes within their
          campus.
        </p>
        <h4>How do you become a Sherpa?</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Anyone who has the will to lead the herd is capable of becoming a
          Campus Sherpa! We need enthusiastic students who are experienced in
          managing and organizing events inside their campus or outside their
          campus. Anyone who is eager to gain practical knowledge and implement
          it to create a simulation of the Group of Twenty can opt for this
          Programme.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          In order to register as a Sherpa, one has to go through an application
          process. The process comprises a comprehensive registration form
          pertaining to the applicant’s details. An applicant is also required
          to acquire a minimum of 5 students from the same institution who will
          act as volunteers for the Programme.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Before one signs up for being a Sherpa, one needs to have the G20
          Genius Certificate.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          The G20 Genius Certificate is a unique educational tool that treats
          the background, role, activities, goals, and challenges of the G20 as
          pedagogical knowledge. The interactive learning orientation lasts 45
          minutes and covers all the important information about the G20. It is
          designed specifically for young people, making it easy for them to
          grasp and discover the information they need without growing tired. It
          engages the user with amusing animations, audio-visuals, quizzes,
          Q&As, and DIY exercises. By placing an emphasis on presenting India's
          initiatives and culture to the rest of the world, it seeks to produce
          societal influencers and torch bearers of the G20 Programme known as
          "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" and subtly affect the collective conscience.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 className="fs-1 mt-4">Why become a Sherpa?</h4>
        <h4>● International Relations</h4>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          An understanding of the international ties between the constituent
          members is necessary for everyone partaking in the Model G20 summit,
          especially a Campus Sherpa. International relations refer to the study
          of the relations of states with each other and with international
          organizations and sub-national entities. Delegating as a member state
          helps one in learning and understanding such ties and being able to
          find solutions towards grievances. A campus sherpa learns the ties to
          create awareness strategies for their students.
        </p>
        <h4>● Foreign Affairs</h4>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          A Campus Sherpa in the G20 summit is required to have a good grasp on
          Foreign Affairs pertaining to the member state they are representing.
          Foreign affairs refer to issues concerning the member state's
          interactions with other countries overseas. It is vital for a delegate
          to be aware of the member state’s foreign affairs.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          With over 50% of India’s population being below the age of 25, the
          government has initiated multiple Know India Programmes (KIPs) to
          educate the youth about its external affairs. Moreover, the Model G20
          convention offers a unique forum for learning about international
          affairs and its consequences.
        </p>
        <h4>● National Affairs</h4>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          A Sherpa can also partake as a delegate in the national summit. It is
          well known that in order to effectively represent a member state, a
          delegate should be conversant about its internal issues. Being a
          delegate one gets to learn an enormous amount about the member state’s
          policies, issues, and socio-economic stature.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          A good understanding of current affairs is imperative to succeed in
          any competitive exam. Over 11.5 lakh students applied for UPSC 2022
          exam. Model G20 is a great opportunity to strengthen one’s internal
          current affairs and prepare for these competitive exams in a jubilant
          manner.
        </p>
        <h4>● Macroeconomics</h4>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          The G20 brings together the world's major and systemically important
          economies. India is on its way to becoming the fifth largest economy
          in the world. Over time, a delegate develops a thorough awareness of
          the macroeconomic ties involving many countries, not only India. This
          will enlighten one’s comprehension of economic relationships and what
          determines the economic stature of a country.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          With countries such as Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Russia, and Zambia drowning
          in economic crises, the delegates have an opportunity to present their
          opinions and find world class solutions.
        </p>
        <h4>● Youth Awareness and Networking</h4>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          The Model G20 acts as an awareness Programme for the youth of India.
          It enables the youth to dive deep into socio-political matters and
          fetch for solutions. This process creates a sense of responsibility as
          an individual and boosts awareness about what is happening around
          them.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          This conference collects thousands of people from various walks to
          come together and deliberate. It acts as a pivot to enlarge one's
          network. It is a stepping stone for those who wish to expand their
          social circuit and leave a mark.
        </p>
        <h4>● Diplomacy</h4>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          War is a failure of diplomacy and thus, it is extremely crucial for
          all member states to be diplomatic in their stance while looking out
          for themselves. While representing a member state, one learns the art
          of diplomacy- a trait useful for a lifetime.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          Diplomats try to help their own country, encourage cooperation between
          nations, and maintain peace. This opportunity enables one to have
          confidence, patience, the ability to listen, the openness of mind and
          heart to compromise, and the drive to complete the work demanded.
        </p>
        <h4>● Public Speaking</h4>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          The act of speaking face to face to a live audience often brings
          shivers to most. It is an art not inherited to all, but an art to be
          acquired. Being a Campus Sherpa in the Model G20 will give you plenty
          of opportunity to burst your bubble and face your fears.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          Individuals with experience in speaking in front of groups are said to
          be better at interviews in the future. In the summit each participant
          has to put forth their stance and diplomatically approach the issues
          presented to them. One has to debate, dialogue, and deliberate, in
          order to make the events successful..
        </p>
        <h4>● Research Analysis</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          It is important to be aware of what one is hosting. Being a campus
          sherpa, one has to have a rough idea about trends, political and
          modern, in order to attract large numbers. Thus a thorough
          understanding of it is required.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          Research and Development is a part of every industry. At the end of
          the conference, not only will you have gained immense knowledge, you
          will have improved your research and analytical skills, which will
          definitely help you in the future.
        </p>
        <h4>● Communication Skills</h4>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          Speaking publicly is one thing, but communicating your viewpoints to
          people is another. The process of voicing your opinions to safeguard
          your plans of action and then guiding the volunteers towards your idea
          creates great opportunities to work on your communicating skills.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          Most HR employers have stressed over the importance of good
          communication skills during an interview. Good communication and
          interpersonal skills improve the way one operates through their life.
          Lobbying during and after a committee session is vital for your
          victory and prepares you for proper communication after..
        </p>
        <h4>● Leadership Skills</h4>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          Hosting a summit of such stature requires leadership skills. One needs
          to manage a team and work with a diverse group of people. This
          sharpens your skills to lead a community of individuals.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          As a Sherpa, convincing people to be on your team also instills
          leadership qualities within you. Assuring other members that their
          concerns will be raised while being the author of one’s own resolution
          requires a sense of leadership. All these experiences prepare you for
          the future in a complete manner.
        </p>
        <h4>● Event Management</h4>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          The process of conducting the conference on campus is not a small task
          but is of first nature to our Campus Sherpas. It is a series of
          decisions that lead up to the summit. It covers multiple aspects of
          managing an event of such scale and helps you in problem solving
          abilities. At the end of the conference as a Sherpa, you will be
          confident in managing individuals and events that will always come
          handy in the future.
        </p>
        <h4>● Certifications</h4>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          Most importantly, all Sherpas will get certifications that will attest
          for the above mentioned skill set. They also reflect the hardwork and
          knowledge incorporated in this tenure. With such legitimate
          certifications, anybody’s resume will stand out.
