          Education’s significance lies powerfully intact in the above quote by the hon’ble prime minister.
          Education is a process of acquiring sound knowledge and a deeper understanding of various ideas,
          concepts and subjects that we come across in our daily lives.

          It is not limited to books and lectures, but plenty of practical experiences and social experiments that

        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          According to Universal Human Rights Article 26, ‘everyone has a right to education.’ It clearly lays
          emphasis on the basic human right of delivering education to all without any bias, stereotypes or
          discrimination. In a broader sense education is important for various reasons;

          Moreover, global institutions like United Nations, UNESCO, and World Bank have initiated worldwide
          campaigns like Education for All (EFA) to prioritise the significance of education for all developing and
          developed nations to adopt.

        <h3>What is Education for All?</h3>
        <p>
          The global Education for All (EFA) initiative was conceived at the UNESCO world conference in 1990.
          Delegations from almost 155 nations, non-profit organisations, and government authorities voted to
          universalize primary education thereby reducing illiteracy by the end of the decade.
        </p>
        <p>
          While discussing the EFA initiative, it was collectively asserted by the World Declaration on Education
          for All that, ‘every child, youth, adult will be able to benefit from the educational opportunities
          formed to meet their basic learning requirements.’
        </p>
        <br />
        <hr />
        <h3>
          Major Goals under EFA
        </h3>
        <p>
          At World Education Forum (2000), a coalition of national governments, civil groups and human
          development organisations was formed whose main objective was to achieve the global education
          for All (EFA) agendas in six specific areas or goals by 2015, they are:

        </p>
        <ol className='p-5'>
          <li>
            <p>
              To improve and expand early childhood care and education specifically for the most
              disadvantaged children.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To ensure the learning needs of all youth and adults are met with equal access to proper
              learning and life-skills programmes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To achieve at least 50% improvement in adult literacy by 2015 and equal access to basic
              continued education for all adults.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To eliminate any gender disparity in primary and secondary education and achieve gender
              equality in education by 2015 with a prime focus on girls’ equal and basic education of fair
              quality.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To ensure that all children belonging to diverse ethnic minorities or difficult situations have
              access to free and compulsory primary education of good quality.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To address all aspects of educational quality and ensure excellence so that proper learning
              outcomes are achieved.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Besides, as the central agency, UNESCO has made it mandatory for all to coordinate and contribute
          to global efforts to reach education for all. Today, governments, NGOs, civil societies are working
          tenaciously towards reaching these goals.

        <h3>
          Education for All in India
        </h3>
        <p>
          The mandate of EFA was widely received by India and other countries to raise awareness and active
          support for education for all. Besides, India has necessarily updated its national policy with respect
          to its constitutional commitment to allow free and compulsory education for children up to the age
          of 14. Along with this, a unique feature has also been made to provide provisions of universal
          education to all under articles 45 and 21A.
        </p>
        <p>
          Central and state governments over the years have made dutiful efforts to launch various schemes
          and policies to expand education channels across the nation. For instance, the Shiksha Karmi Project,
          District Primary Education Programme, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, National Programme of Nutritional
          Support to Primary Education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the passing of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) act in 2009
          was a historic move under which it became a fundamental right for every child between 6-14 years
          to receive 8 years of compulsory elementary schooling. With such poignant steps, the education
          system in India has seen great progress over the past few decades and it continues to grow

          <h4 className='fs-2'>How India contributes towards EFA Goals?</h4>
          <p>
            The EFA initiative has provided a positive impact to the programmes that are working to achieve
            education for all in India. The nation focuses on the overall development of human capacities as
            these capabilities are instrumental in gaining productive results for the economic and social growth
            of the country.

          </p>
          <p>
            Since India has a younger population, a well-educated population is all the more essential for India’s
            social and economic development. Hence, such initiatives can contribute significantly to India’s
            potential if the youngsters are well-equipped with sound skills and relevant knowledge required for
            life and work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, it will be necessary to ensure that the youth enter the work culture with higher education
            backup and the right set of skills needed to support the rapid economic growth of the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, India remains actively present and has come a long way since the inception of the EFA campaign
            in the 90s. It provides universal access to education to more than 199 million children and an equity
            dividend with gender parity at elementary level education. Not only this but one of the largest
            mid-day meal programmes in India provides access to quality meals to over 108 million children in
            order to maintain their retention.

          <p className='mb-5'>

            According to the 2014 national review on education by the National University of Educational
            Planning and Administration (NUEPA), India has resolved to work towards quality education and
            understanding children’s achievement over time in an equitable manner when it comes to EFA goals.

              <h4 className='fs-4'>Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)</h4>
              <p>
                Under ECCE, the National Early Childhood Care and Education Policy in 2013 was launched that
                focuses on the vision of integrated development and holistic care of children up to age 6. Moreover,
                the ECCE services in India are implemented through three mediums- private, public and NGOs.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to UNICEF, age groups of 0-8 years are the most crucial period in terms of a child’s
                cognitive, social and physical growth and development. So, ECCE is a comprehensive approach to
                formulating plans and interventions that lay a solid foundation for lifelong learning for children.
              </p>
              <p>As per the latest revisions in the National Education Policy 2022, the ECCE comprises multi-level,
                multi-faceted, flexible, inquiry, play and activity-based learning. Moreover, this way of learning
                focuses to develop good behaviour, teamwork, social and personal development, and courtesy in
                children.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Indian education policy of 2022 abundantly describes the overall aim of ECCE in various factions
                of development like socio-emotional-ethical, cognitive and motor skills, communication skills, artistic
                development, etc. Therefore, the policy provides all young children universal access to quality
                education in early childhood care and pre-primary learning.
              </p>
              <p>Private ECCE services include kindergartens, nurseries, and pre-primary schools that contribute in
                educating the youngest groups of children in urban areas. Various non-profit institutions and NGOs
                have conducted several ECCE innovative programmes that centre around children belonging to the
                most disadvantaged factions of society.

                Universalisation of Elementary Education
              </h4>
              <p>
                India in its attempt to carry forward the universalisation of elementary education message has
                undertaken serious efforts. The idea is to bridge the gender and social gaps, universal enrolment and
                retention and elementary education of satisfying quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has been instrumental in this process. The scheme facilitates
                universal access and enrolment and substantially contributes towards primary and upper primary
                schooling expansion. One of the key aspects of SSA has been to ensure that all children in the age
                group of 6-14 years have access to elementary schooling within a reasonable range from their house.

              </p>
              <p>
                Then there is the Right to Education (RTE) act that provides children access to elementary schools
                within a defined area or limits in their neighbourhood. Undoubtedly, the RTE act has added great
                influence to the efforts of universal elementary education promotion.

              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the guiding principles of universalisation of elementary education include: <span className='fw-bold'>Providing access
                  to schools</span> to all children within a specified distance, especially for minority group children; <span className="fw-bold">Having a
                    holistic outlook</span> towards curriculum, teacher education, and planning; <span className="fw-bold">Having a centrality of
                      teachers</span> to inspire, motivate them to innovate and create unique learning classroom culture;
              </p>
              <p>
                <span className="fw-bold">Ensuring a decisive intervention</span> to remove the gender disparity and raising the status of women
                among men.

              <p>The EFA goal of young people’s education has been a significant component in the education
                development domain in India. Many schemes and programmes have been launched by several
                ministries of India to create an effective learning environment for the sake of young and adult
                development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main focus of such initiatives has been to build a system that supports continued learning
                prospects, having upward mobility of children from elementary to senior education, vocational
                education and promoting life-skill development. Missions like Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan
                (RMSA) are attributed to progressing the expansion of secondary education access and improving the
                education quality at the secondary stage.
