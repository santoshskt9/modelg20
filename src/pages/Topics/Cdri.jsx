        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5 mb-3">
          The Coalition of Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) is a global
          partnership that addresses the issues of creating resilience and
          building systems for infrastructures against natural and man-made
          disasters.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5 mb-3">
          Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched CDRI during his UN
          Climate Summit speech back in 2019. The idea of forming a coalition
          was initiated by India to improve the quality of disaster resilience
          towards the infrastructure and collectively work to ensure sustainable
          development. The CDRI currently has 31 member countries and 7
          international groups like the World Bank Group, European Union, etc.
          This global partnership promotes disaster-resilient infrastructure
          with a series of consultations, financing mechanisms, and development
          reforms with efforts of advocacy at multiple national and
          international forums.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5 mb-3">
          The governing authority of the CDRI is divided into three groups: the
          Governing Council, The Executive Committee and the Secretariat. The
          headquarters of the CDRI Secretariat is in New Delhi, India.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5 mb-3">
          The coalition is a multi-faceted platform that adopts a uniquely
          inclusive approach to offer knowledge and decisive exchange of various
          aspects of disaster resilience of infrastructures. Moreover, its
          multiple stakeholders bring together conjoined capacities, practices,
          standards, and reforms regarding infrastructure development to address
          risk factors, economic needs and the overall sustainable development
          discourse.
        </p>
        <h4 className="fs-2 mt-4">Mission</h4>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          The CDRI was formed to expand the development of resilient
          infrastructure at a rapid pace to answer the imperative sustainable
          development goal of providing basic amenities and increasing the
          world’s wealth side by side.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          In retrospect, CDRI actively supports objectives laid out in the Paris
          Climate Agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
          and the UN Mission 2030 of leaving no one, no place and no ecosystem
          behind.
        </p>
        <p className="text-darkmb-3">
          CDRI’s global mission is to provide guided assistance to developed and
          developing countries in upgrading their existing systems towards
          climate and disaster resilience. Moreover, it aims to raise perpetual
          awareness at multiple levels for the sake of strong infrastructure
          systems by building links between codes, design, planning, operations,
          and maintenance of those systems.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          Take a look at the following subject areas that highlight CDRI’s work
          on the global platform.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          The role of community participation is receiving worldwide recognition
          in today’s time. So, by formulating capacities of local groups and
          communicating with vulnerable communities, CDRI aims to absorb and
          assimilate the needs of disaster-resilient infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          It will also create community partnerships with local builders to
          enhance disaster resilience with a prime focus on gender sensitivity,
          communal sentimentality, inclusion and capacity building. For CDRI,
          gaining significant regional inputs is vital to reduce discriminative
          provisions of disaster-resilient infrastructure.
        </p>
        <h4 className="fs-2 mt-4">Risk Identification</h4>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          Estimating and identifying risks is crucial in the infrastructural
          sector be it the large-scale or small-scale scope of hazards. This is
          because it helps in creating better disaster relief systems and
          designing strong resilient plans.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          CDRI aims to work in risk identification from natural or man-made
          calamities, probe into their impacts and formulate disaster resilience
          plans to mitigate larger risks in infrastructure. Moreover, it can
          design sector-oriented or national risk assessments across various
          regions.
        </p>
        <h4 className="fs-2 mt-4">Governing Policies</h4>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          To create a climate and disaster-resilient infrastructure, having
          strong governing bodies with smart policy executions is important. The
          ruling authority brings in growth, investment, and inclusivity of
          infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          As a coalition of disaster risk resilience, CDRI will estimate the
          elements of risks and come up with innovative ideas, tools to
          transport that information, and policies across member governments and
          national groups. Also, it will identify and leverage opportunities to
          gain associations with private sectors for constructing resilient
          infrastructure.
        </p>
        <h4 className="fs-2 mt-4">Recovery and Reconstruction</h4>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          Any form of disaster, natural or man-made, is a direct threat to a
          nation’s infrastructure and leads to massive long-term damages that
          cannot be calculated in better terms. No matter the scale of loss and
          damage, the rehabilitation and recovery process is a waking sign for
          countries to make better plans for infrastructure resilience and
          preventive measures for the community.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          CDRI comes in as a bridge for this sole purpose. The coalition will
          work to support the recovery and reconstruction of nations in either
          instance of pre-calamity or post-calamity. In pre-scenario, it will
          provide development and adaptive mechanisms for assessing losses and
          transferring adequate finances to disaster-affected regions instantly.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          Similarly, in post-scenario, it will help to mobilise instant
          communique to disaster-stricken countries to integrate resilience
          through the rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and downtrodden
          services.
        </p>
        <h4 className="fs-2 mt-4">Emerging Technology</h4>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          The major plus of any new technology is that its scope and potential
          are unknown and unutilised. At times, emerging technological
          applications and resources come with breakthrough innovations whose
          impact can be massive for the community. For instance, big data,
          nanotechnology, Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, etc. are
          real-life applications of current technological innovations.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          With the help of these new unused innovations, CDRI will create new
          platforms that collect information and share the inputs with resilient
          infrastructure communities around the world so that they may adopt
          them into their infrastructure construction plan. Moreover, it will
          work closely to study new technical trends and leverage its web of
          experts, researchers and scientific partners to build a better
          ecosystem of resilience.
        </p>
        <h4 className="fs-2">Financing</h4>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          Finance is an important signifier for any infrastructure resilience
          plan. Identifying risk financing strategies and priorities widely
          depend on resources, capacity and will to manage risks. It is crucial
          to note that funding and investing in infrastructure projects is a
          challenging feat because public reserves and government treasuries are
          insufficient and need private sector handouts to properly mobilise
          resilience building.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          CDRI will promote and provide guided support to nations in developing
          monetary solutions for infrastructure financing through proper
          schematic frameworks of public cum private investments. Besides, CDRI
          will also assist in implementing comprehensive disaster risk
          finance(DRF) model to protect the collected funds from fiscal shocks
          and uncertain monetary markets.
        </p>
        <h4 className="fs-2">Certifications and Standards</h4>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          It is significant to have decent standards that must be followed while
          formulating resilient infrastructure systems. This is because those
          standards help the infrastructure framework to undergo any disaster
          impacts as well as climatic disturbances. Such certifications maintain
          the faith and assurances of the investors who invest in the
          infrastructure assets.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-3">
          CDRI plays a role in adopting suitable mechanisms for developing,
          enforcing and upgrading regulations for resilient infrastructures
          given the dynamic nature of technology and disaster risks.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark mb-2">
          For any futuristic initiative to work and prosper, there are some
          guided agendas or principles at work that help keep the focus in
          place. Keeping that in mind, the CDRI promises to work in the
          following stance:

            </span>{" "}
            <span className="ps-2 fs-5">
              In accordance with its mission, CDRI will always address the
              requirements and needs of the most disaster-prone regions with a
              special focus on women, children, the elderly and
              differently-abled citizens.

            <span className="ps-2 fs-5">
              The CDRI will work on issues related to inter boundary
              infrastructure resilience and for that, it will use a flexible
              method that meets the needs of scope, the scale of the region and
              its geographical environment.

            The Coalition of Disaster Resilient Infrastructure as a global
            platform works on the following three vital strategic programmes.
            <br />
            - Advocacy and Partnerships: This particular programme focuses on
            bridging the gap between knowledge and execution between members. It
            promotes the safe distribution of knowledge of ideas through digital
            or print platforms and one-on-one workshops. It also forwards the
            CDRI functioning alignments with other various global campaigns.
            <br />
            - Research and Knowledge Management: This programme was made to
            advertise the collaborative research by-products and systems to
            members to have a better purview to build resilient infrastructure.
            Also, this includes a global database of resilience and sector-focus
            information with flagship reports.
            <br />
            - Technical Support and Capacity Creation: This programme acts as an
            anchor between various national and international development
            projects with a prime focus on technical support and innovation. It
            includes creating capacities, altering risk governance and funding
            resilience infrastructure through standard certifications.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <h4 className="fs-2"> CDRI Agenda in G20</h4>
          <p>
            India originally proposed CDRI as regulating governance that acts
            with due diligence to curtail infrastructure losses due to
            calamities. The hope was to build a globalised platform that works
            on multiple levels promoting smart disaster resilience and building
            better resources for infrastructure sectors to avoid them.
            <br />
            Now, as the rotating president of G20 for 2023, India will carry
            forward the CDRI mission to promote the broader terms of sustainable
            development goals for the world.
            <br />
            As the coalition was formulated to be aware and ready for helping
            both developed and developing nations, India as the world leader
            will highlight its pro-active ‘zero casualty approach’ as a decent
            example.
            <br />
            In the G20 summit, CDRI will emphasize India’s diplomatic efforts to
            build the coalition of disaster risk reduction of countries using
            solar power concerning the International Solar Alliance (ISA)
            framework. This means that ISA has multiplied India’s position as a
            solution creator to the most pressing global issues.
            <br />
            As part of the G20 Sherpa Track, India has formulated working groups
            of experts, researchers and officials from various ministries who
            will share detailed theses, and discussions on matters of
            international relevance. In this context, a Disaster Risk Reduction
            working group has been created under India’s G20 presidency.
            <br />
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4 className="fs-2"> Disaster Risk Reduction</h4>
          <p>
            Simply put, disaster risk reduction is defined as locating possible
            natural and man-made vulnerabilities or hazards and thus taking
            corrective measures to stop the disaster from happening. This type
            of risk reduction is important because for any country the economy
            and developmental progress can go on the backfoot with the smallest
            disaster. Moreover, if proper disaster checks are absent, it puts
            communal harmony at a larger risk.
            <br />
            So, proper compliance and regulating bodies are needed to send out
            the distress signal beforehand so that the nation’s hard-earned
            growth is not on the verge of destruction. For instance: Incorrect
            building infrastructure around seas could lead to grave loss of
            lives and property at times of tsunamis or quakes.
            <br /> India at the G20 will ideate new norms and methodologies to
            build infrastructure resilience in association with CDRI. To achieve
            that, India has come up with a Disaster Risk Reduction working group
            to address the issue more coherently and encourage collaborations
            with G20 leaders to have multi-disciplinary exchange talks on
            disaster reduction and infrastructure resilience.
