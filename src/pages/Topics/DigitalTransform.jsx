        <h3>India’s Digital Transformation</h3>
        <h4 className="fs-2">Overview</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Ever since 1947, India has achieved great new heights in the field of
          science, infrastructure and technology. From upgrading its foreign
          policies, national interests to adopting newer forms of technological
          innovations, India has truly succeeded in shedding away its colonised
          identity into a fast-growing free market economy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Introducing new forms of digital inventions like UPI, India has
          propelled progressively to show its potential as an emerging leader of
          the future.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “I see technology as a means to empowerment and as a tool that bridges
          the distance between hope and opportunity.”
          <p className="mb-0">
            by <span className="text-primary">PM Narendra Modi</span>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Enabling every Indian with smartphones and fast-speed internet is one
          of the objectives of Modi’s vision for a complete digital
          transformation of the country. Besides, the core values of this
          initiative are low cost-effectiveness, inclusivity and indigenous
          nature that would bring harmony and opportunities for digital
          inclusion.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Achieving PM Modi’s billion-dollar digitised economy dream should be a
          source of motivation for all Indian citizens. It could be from
          acquiring new business ideals of entrepreneurship, developments in the
          field of blockchain, artificial intelligence, IT sector or connecting
          remote corners of the country through 5G.
        </p>
        <h4 className="fs-2">What Makes India a Digital Hotspot?</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          It would be unfair to celebrate the digital renaissance of India’s
          progress without crediting its dynamic industry providers, tech-savvy
          innovators, optimistic lawmakers and ambitious citizens
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          It is believed that by the end of this decade, the Indian economy will
          be worth US$5 trillion with US$1 trillion to be credited to the
          digital economy alone.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          So, what makes India an ideal candidate for digital transformation?
          One can think of many reasons to answer like the technically inclined
          workforce pool, competitive commercial markets or middleclass
          expansion. Some more reasons are as follows:
        </p>
        <h4>Government Lending Support</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Central and state authorities have created a plethora of campaigns,
          and initiatives with digitisation in mind and a disciplined regulatory
          approach to allow businesses, and individuals to thrive in all
          sectors.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Moreover, the Indian government consistently tries to work on all
          levels to make it accessible for all companies to ideate, invest or
          set up their operations.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          For instance, through public interest initiatives such as Aspirants
          District Programme, the government aims to spread the wave of
          technology in order to improve people’s participation in Indian
          economic development. Besides, data-driven laws that are supported by
          IT norms are made to solidify the progress of the growth potential.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Take a look as follows at some of the notable government-led digital
          programmes.
        </p>
        <h4>Digital India</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          To empower the common man of India with technology, Modi Led
          government launched the Digital India programme. It aims to work
          towards the digital transformation of the country through its various
          schemes and policies.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          For instance, Jan-Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity has made sure that
          poor people receive their entitled benefits on time. On the other
          hand, SWAMITVA Yojana is working towards sending out digitised land
          records to rightful owners.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Just like that, through Digital India, the government carries the
          herculean attempt to provide internet access to the farthest corner of
          the country, introducing digital literacy programmes and more.
        </p>
        <h4>UPI ( Union Paid Interface) Apps</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          One of the most well-received innovations from the Indian government
          is the launch of Union Paid Interface (UPI) method of digital
          payments. This method has not just simplified digital transactions as
          a whole but also created faith in technology for citizens.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          In July 2022, UPI transactions across India crossed US$6 billion which
          was applauded by hon’ble PM Modi who asserted, “this indicates
          collective resolve of Indian citizens to embrace digital technology
          and make the economy cleaner."
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Day-to-day operations dealing with direct payment models have been
          transferred to e-transaction methodology of UPIs, which is a great
          step towards digital transformation for India.
        </p>
        <h4>CoWIN App</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Covid-19 struck hard and strong in every corner of the country. The
          government introduced CoWIN app as a digital platform to support and
          spread Covid vaccination efforts in India. CoWin has played a major
          role in the government’s attempt of simplifying the vaccine
          administration process through a single point of enrolment method.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Moreover, as a part of the 2019 service delivery ecosystem that
          facilitates better information inflow in the healthcare sector, CoWIN
          has provided crucial lessons to strengthen digital service delivery
          architecture in the country.
        </p>
        <h4>MyGov App</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          To create more inclusivity amongst citizens of all backgrounds, the
          government has launched the myGov app. It is a social platform that
          invited people to connect with the government and contribute towards
          ideal governance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          As of today, the app has almost 24.5 million registered users. Almost
          all government-led institutions and organisations use the platform to
          leverage engagement from users by posting about the latest events,
          workshops, campaigns, contests etc.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          The app thrives on the mantra of citizen engagement and participation
          by creating feedback portals, editorials, quizzes, and opinion polls
          for users to bridge the socio-political gap within the nation.
        </p>
        <h4>Eager-to-Learn Youth</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          India has groomed one of the most learned, technologically advanced
          and curious sets of achievers as its generation. For them, nothing is
          impossible. Time and again, Youth of India has taken smart measures
          when the prestige of India’s global recognition is at stake.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          For instance, thanks to viral trend culture, youth worked tenaciously
          to spread the Covid vaccine assistance to remote places during the
          pandemic.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          Similarly, for digital transformation, youth can play a pivotal role
          as their minds and technology are at the same wavelengths, and thus
          could help assimilate and spread the new technology to other factions
          effortlessly.
        </p>
        <h4>Startups Society</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          With the Indian startups taking the global platform by storm, it is
          worthy to note that startups society are driving force of the digital
          renaissance of the Indian economy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          With the Indian startups taking the global platform by storm, it is
          worthy to note that startups society are driving force of the digital
          renaissance of the Indian economy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          As startups are instrumental groups between technology and economic
          development, it’s only fair that as an emerging nation with super-fast
          digital growth, India is carrying forward the discourse to the global
          level.
        </p>
        <h4 className="fs-2">Digital Transformation in G20</h4>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          One of the prime agendas for India as the G20 president is carrying
          forward the communication of digital technology and transformation in
          the 2023 summit.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “The principle of ‘data for development will be an integral part of
          the overall theme of our presidency.”
          <p className="mb-0">
            by <span className="text-primary">PM Narendra Modi</span>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          The prime minister’s vision for digital transformation with regard to
          the future is “most remarkable.” He believes that with proper use of
          technology, it can fight decades-long global poverty with massive
          force.
        </p>
        <p className="text-dark fs-5">
          India hopes to share its UPI success story with the world in G20 to
          inspire more traction towards the digital upliftment of society as a
          whole. India’s inclusive digital measures can be a powerful motivator
          to bring governance in scale and speed with the changing times.
