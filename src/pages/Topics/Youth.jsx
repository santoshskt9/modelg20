                It is specifically dedicated to the young, ambitious and

                We at Yuvamanthan believe that India is a land of tradition and
                innovation that mixes well with the impressionable minds of
                today’s youth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Did you know that India has the largest youth concentration in
                the world with almost 430 million citizens in the age group of
                16-35 years. Talk about national pride, right?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-5">
                As youngsters today are more inclined towards Social Awareness,

                The team of Yuvamanthan has planned to create an open platform
                for youth to start discussions and open communications via
                multiple channels to connect, contribute and change.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to recent findings, it is inferred that youngsters who
                possess diverse qualities like creativity, and logical intellect
                can have a more positive influence over the masses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, these findings have further encouraged in growth and
                development of certain proactive interventions and initiatives
                to strengthen youth’s capacity to aspire and inspire.
