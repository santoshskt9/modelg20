        <p>
          Working from anywhere and automation, two of the key developments that
          will transform the future of work, have come together in the last few
          years. As businesses strive to manage remote workforces and worker
          proximity difficulties, the pandemic has sped up the deployment of
          automation throughout the world
        </p>
        <p>
          India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan are the countries least prepared for
          the oncoming wave of automation and the ones most at risk of losing
          their employment to it, according to the "The Future of Work is Now:
          Is APAC Ready?" assessment commissioned by the Autodesk Foundation.
          India is ninth in preparation and fifth in terms of danger. The risk
          is greatest in labor-intensive industries including agriculture,
          manufacturing, and construction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the fact that 83% of workers in India still feel anxious about
          returning to the office, Indians are also more inclined than people in
          other nations to wish to work entirely from home. Businesses have also
          adopted technology slowly or not at all, depending on the most recent
          developments. Additionally, there aren't many programmes to retrain
          staff members in using these technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The degree of readiness of nations and industries will determine
          whether they profit from these developments, even as automation offers
          chances for new, more fulfilling sorts of labor by replacing
          monotonous, repetitive activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The potential of Industry 4.0 may be unlocked while also supporting
          India's move to a hybrid or remote working style through the adoption
          of automation and cloud technology. Workers can move into new
          technology-assisted occupations by improving their digital literacy,
          helping underprivileged workers, building strong infrastructure, and
          teaching skills.

        <h3>Gig Economy: The New Age Industry</h3>
        <p>
          A new economic revolution is being ushered in by the quickly expanding
          gig workforce globally. With its demographic dividend, India has the
          world's youngest population, a workforce of half a billion people,
          rising urbanization, widespread use of smartphones and related
          technology—this is the new frontier of this revolution. In light of
          this context, this groundbreaking analysis offers in-depth analyses
          and suggestions on the gig-platform industry in India, which employs
          millions of gig workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          A report titled "India's Booming Gig and Platform Economy" was
          released by NITI Aayog. The report projects that by 2029–30, India's
          gig employment will increase to 2.35 crore. According to the research,
          the gig economy employed 77 lakh (7.7 million) employees in 2020–21.
          They made up 1.5% of India's overall labor force or 2.6% of the
          non-agricultural workforce. According to the Code on Social Security,
          NITI Aayog advocated extending social security benefits to these
          workers and their families in partnership mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gig workers – those engaged in livelihoods outside the traditional
          employer-employee arrangement – can be broadly classified into
          platform and non-platform-based workers. Platform employees are those
          whose jobs rely on digital platforms or online software tools.
          Non-platform gig workers typically work part- or full-time in the
          traditional sectors as own-account and casual wage workers.

        <p>
          According to an Economic Survey, there was at least one new company in
          555 of India's districts, illustrating the sharp increase in the
          number of startups over the previous six years, with a sizable portion
          of them based in IT-related industries. India's startup environment
          has grown in the previous six years, with the number of newly
          recognised firms rising sharply from 733 in 2016–17 to over 14,000 in
          2021–22. After the United States and China, India has the
          third-largest startup ecosystem in the world in 2017. The overall
          number of unicorn startups in India increased to 83 in 2021 with 44
          Indian companies achieving this status, the majority of which are in
          the services industry. The USA tops the list with about 460 unicorns,

          Today, Industry 4.0 encompasses implementing big data, robotics, the
          internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, machine learning
          and cloud services for automation and autonomous operations in
          industries. It becomes necessary primarily as a result of rising
          demand and market competitiveness. India is one of the fastest-growing
          economies among emerging ones. Due to the soaring population and
          market competitiveness brought on by globalization and privatization,
          it is subject to rising demands. In order to support the demand-driven
          economy and maintain the competition on the international markets, it
          is important for the Indian industry to accept improvements in
          manufacturing procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The implementation of Industry 4.0 across India's manufacturing
          sectors is supported by a number of policies. Across the nation, smart
          manufacturing hubs are emerging, including one at the Indian Institute
          of Science in Karnataka's Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing.
          This mirrors the ambitious goal of raising manufacturing's
          contribution to the GDP from its current level of 16% to 25% by 2025.
          According to management consulting company McKinsey & Company, Indian
          enterprises might increase their operating profit by 40% and decrease
          their anticipated capital investment by 10% simply by implementing
          Industries 4.0.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from capital, skilled labor is essential for implementing
          Industry 4.0, which requires sophisticated machinery and automated
          systems. The advanced techniques need skilled labor to operate them.
          The availability and price of competent labor present two problems.
          For the implementation and operation of cutting-edge equipment and
          systems, skilled labor is in short supply. Even if they are available
          in some cases, their cost is a problem. An MSME firm's hiring of
          skilled labor raises operating costs and presents an operational
          challenge to the viability of the firm. Therefore, the barrier for
          MSMEs seeking automation, sophistication, and upgradation is not just
          the capital investment but also the hiring of skilled labor. When it
          comes to skilled labor, there is some good news. Industries may
          benefit from upskilling current employees through academic
          partnership, apprenticeship, and industrial training. Overall, the
          productivity of the sectors is increased by the workforce
          transitioning from low-skill (manual) occupations to high-skill
          (automation) positions. This suggests that Industry 4.0 deployment,
          which includes labor upskilling, will increase the sector's production
          and efficiency
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, we covered the multiple aspects of Industry 4.0
          application in Indian industry—scale and skill—with also focus on
          MSMEs. MSMEs are unable to invest in modernizing their operations and
          implementing Industry 4.0 because of their lack of scale and
          expertise. Moreover, Manufacturing companies, especially MSMEs, need
          policy support to encourage staff upskilling and modernization
          expenditures. It will encourage the Indian industry to adopt Industry
          4.0 practices and advance its global competitiveness.
