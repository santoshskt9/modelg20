                  GLC holds no patents or copyrights for (the “Event”) and is
                  merely a coordinator/agency to help organize (the “Event”) in
                  educational institutions and venues decided by their
                  authorities.
                </p>
                <h5>APPLICATION TERMS</h5>
                <p>

                  GLC or its associates do not know (the “Applicant”) personally
                  and expect all information shared by the applicant to be true
                  and fair. Any liability arising out of the falsification of
                  information will be the sole responsibility of the applicant.

                  understands that (the “Applicant”) is “Volunteering” to
