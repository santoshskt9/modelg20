                    Our leadership team strives to make YMG20 an impactful summit. Our
                    team consists of experts and volunteers who are working closely with other
                    stakeholders to ensure that the summit is a resounding success. The
                    coordination and efforts span from creating content, developing IT
                    infrastructure and promotional strategies to working closely with G20
                    experts and educational institutions.

                <p>
                    We also have a team of student volunteers who do most of the
                    groundwork for the institutional-level events called ‘Campus Sherpas’. We
                    especially thank the Teacher Coordinators who eventually make it all
                    happen and it goes without saying that Campus Sherpas along with
                    Teacher Coordinators are the backbone of YMG20.
